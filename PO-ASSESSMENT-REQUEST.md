# üìã PO Assessment Request - Temporary Development Fixes

**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Reporter:** Development Team  
**Priority:** High (Blocking Production Deployment)  

## üö® **Situation Summary**

During frontend development, we encountered **HTTP 400 errors every 30 seconds** that were blocking development progress. To unblock the team and continue development, **temporary fixes were applied** that resolved the immediate issues.

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Development can continue without errors  
**Issue:** ‚ùå Temporary fixes are **NOT production-ready**

## üìä **Impact Assessment**

### **What's Working Now:**
- ‚úÖ No more 400 error messages every 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Frontend development can proceed normally
- ‚úÖ API responds successfully (200 status)
- ‚úÖ User interface loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Development velocity maintained

### **What's Missing for Production:**
- ‚ùå **Real-time data:** Currently using static mock data instead of live database
- ‚ùå **Auto-refresh:** Disabled 30-second capacity updates
- ‚ùå **Error resilience:** Reduced retry attempts from 3 to 1
- ‚ùå **Monitoring:** Limited error tracking and fallback monitoring
- ‚ùå **Scalability:** Not tested with real database load

## üîß **Technical Details**

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`apps/web/app/api/capacity/route.ts`**
   - **What Changed:** Replaced complex database API with simple mock endpoint
   - **Why:** Original was causing 400 errors due to missing dependencies
   - **Impact:** Fast response (~100ms) but static data only

2. **`apps/web/hooks/useCapacity.ts`**
   - **What Changed:** Disabled auto-refresh and reduced retries
   - **Why:** Prevented rate limiting (429 errors) during debugging
   - **Impact:** No more spam requests, but missing real-time updates

### **Root Cause:**
The original complex API requires:
- PostgreSQL database with full schema
- Redis caching layer  
- Proper environment variables
- Rate limiting configuration
- Monitoring integration

These infrastructure components are not fully set up in development environment.

## üéØ **Business Impact**

### **If Deployed As-Is (Current State):**
- ‚ùå Users would see **fake capacity data**
- ‚ùå No real-time updates when sessions fill up
- ‚ùå Students might register for full sessions
- ‚ùå Poor user experience with stale information
- ‚ùå Business credibility impact

### **If We Revert to Production Code Without Setup:**
- ‚ùå 400 errors return immediately
- ‚ùå Development blocked again
- ‚ùå No progress on other features
- ‚ùå Timeline delays

## ü§î **PO Decision Required**

### **Option 1: Create Production Integration Story (Recommended)**
**Effort:** 8 story points (~2-3 sprints)  
**Outcome:** Full production-ready system with real database

**Includes:**
- Complete database setup (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- Real-time capacity API with proper caching
- Full error handling and monitoring
- Support for 20 concurrent users
- Comprehensive testing

**Timeline:** Ready for production deployment

### **Option 2: Enhanced Mock System (Quick Fix)**
**Effort:** 3 story points (~1 sprint)  
**Outcome:** Better mock system that mimics production behavior

**Includes:**
- More realistic mock data with variations
- Simulated real-time updates
- Better error handling
- Still not real data, but production-deployable

**Timeline:** Quick deployment possible, migrate later

### **Option 3: Infrastructure-First Approach**
**Effort:** 5 story points (~1-2 sprints)  
**Outcome:** Set up infrastructure first, then restore original code

**Includes:**
- Database and Redis setup
- Environment configuration
- Minimal code changes
- Test with existing complex API

**Timeline:** Medium term, highest risk

## üìã **Recommended Action Items for PO**

### **Immediate (This Sprint):**
- [ ] **Decide** on approach (Option 1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] **Prioritize** the work in product backlog
- [ ] **Assess** business impact vs development timeline
- [ ] **Approve** story creation for chosen option

### **Next Sprint:**
- [ ] **Execute** chosen solution
- [ ] **Test** production readiness
- [ ] **Plan** deployment strategy
- [ ] **Communicate** timeline to stakeholders

## üîç **Information for PO Assessment**

### **Questions for PO to Consider:**
1. **Business Priority:** How critical is real-time capacity data for launch?
2. **Timeline:** Can we delay launch for full database integration?  
3. **Risk Tolerance:** Is enhanced mock system acceptable for v1?
4. **User Experience:** What's minimum viable for student registration?
5. **Technical Debt:** When should we plan full database migration?

### **Stakeholder Impact:**
- **Students:** Need accurate capacity information for registration decisions
- **Administration:** Need real-time monitoring of exam capacity
- **Development:** Need clear direction to avoid rework
- **Business:** Need reliable system for exam period

### **Technical Debt Implications:**
- Temporary fixes create technical debt
- Longer we wait, more complex the migration becomes
- Mock system might become permanent if not addressed early
- Future features will be limited without real database

## üìû **Next Steps**

**For PO to complete:**
1. **Review** this assessment with business stakeholders
2. **Decide** on approach based on business priorities
3. **Inform** development team of decision
4. **Create/Approve** story in backlog with proper priority
5. **Set** expectations with all stakeholders

**Development team will:**
- Wait for PO decision before creating stories
- Maintain current working state during assessment
- Be ready to implement chosen solution immediately
- Provide any additional technical details needed
