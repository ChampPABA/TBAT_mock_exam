# CRITICAL API SPAM ISSUE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Problem Summary
The useCapacity hook is creating infinite API call loops, making thousands of requests per minute to `/api/capacity?format=detailed`. This issue persists despite multiple fix attempts.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **React Strict Mode** in development causing double-mounting
2. **Multiple Hook Instances** being created simultaneously  
3. **useEffect Dependencies** causing infinite re-renders
4. **Global Interval Management** not working correctly

## Immediate Actions Taken
- ✅ Disabled auto-refresh (`refetchInterval: 0`)
- ✅ Memoized callback functions  
- ✅ Added strict mode protection
- ✅ **EMERGENCY**: Completely disabled hook (`enabled: false`)

## Current Status
- API spam **STOPPED** after disabling hook completely
- Development server running at http://localhost:3000
- Manual testing **CANNOT PROCEED** until issue resolved

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Disable React Strict Mode (Quickest Fix)
```javascript
// next.config.mjs
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: false, // Temporary fix for development
}
```

### Option 2: Feature Flag Approach
```typescript
// Environment-based toggle
const ENABLE_REAL_TIME_UPDATES = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development';
```

### Option 3: Enhanced Mock System Only
```typescript
// Use static mock data for development
// Enable real-time only in production
const config = {
  enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  refetchInterval: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 30000 : 0
}
```

## Database Question Answer

**NO DATABASE REQUIRED** according to Story 1.5 AC7:
- "Production deployment ready **WITHOUT database infrastructure dependencies**"
- Enhanced Mock System provides realistic business behavior
- Perfect for MVP/Demo deployment without infrastructure setup

## Next Steps
1. Choose solution approach (recommend Option 1 for immediate fix)
2. Re-enable useCapacity hook with chosen approach
3. Test manual functionality
4. Plan proper fix for production deployment

## Impact Assessment
- **Development**: Cannot test real-time features until fixed
- **Production**: Enhanced Mock System is production-ready as designed
- **Timeline**: Immediate fix needed for development testing
