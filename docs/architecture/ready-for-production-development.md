### 7\. Special Content Rendering

- **Unicode:** The application will use UTF-8 encoding by default.
- **LaTeX (Mathematical Formulas):** The frontend will use a library like **KaTeX** (`react-katex`) to parse and render LaTeX strings from the database into properly formatted mathematical equations.
- **SMILES (Chemical Formulas):** If chemical structure data is provided in the SMILES format, a library like **SMILES-drawer** will be used to render them as SVG images.
