# TBAT Mock Exam Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• **Market Penetration:** Successfully establish TBAT Mock Exam Platform as the primary provider of realistic offline mock exams in Chiang Mai and Northern Thailand region

• **Revenue Generation:** Achieve profitable freemium model with 40-50% Free-to-Advanced conversion during registration and 25-35% post-exam upgrade rate

• **User Value Delivery:** Provide high school students with realistic TBAT preparation through hybrid offline exam + advanced online analytics experience

• **Technical Excellence:** Deliver mobile-first platform supporting 300+ concurrent users during registration periods with 99.9% uptime during critical periods

• **Compliance Leadership:** Establish first PDPA-compliant mock exam platform in Thai market, setting new standard for student data protection

• **Accessibility & Inclusion:** Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliant platform accessible across all devices and economic tiers through freemium model

### Background Context

High school students in Northern Thailand face significant disadvantages preparing for TBAT (Thai Biomedical Admissions Test), with most high-quality mock exams centralized in Bangkok, requiring costly travel and accommodation. This creates a clear market gap where 200+ annual students in Chiang Mai region lack access to realistic, paper-based mock exams that simulate actual test conditions.

The TBAT Mock Exam Platform addresses this gap through a unique hybrid model combining physical exam events with advanced digital analytics. Students register online for a scheduled physical mock exam on 27 กันยายน 2568 (8 days before the real TBAT on 5 ตุลาคม 2568), take paper-based exams in formal timed settings, then access comprehensive performance analytics online within 48 hours. This approach leverages ASPECT organization's credibility (previous Dentorium Camp organizer), government support (STeP, Deepa, Startup Thailand), and Olympic วิชาการ certified reviewers to create the most realistic and valuable TBAT preparation experience available outside Bangkok.
