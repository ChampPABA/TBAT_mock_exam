## 1. Overview & Vision

This project aims to develop and launch the "TBAT Mock Exam Box Set," a hybrid offline/online solution for high school students in Chiang Mai preparing for the Thai Biomedical Admissions Test (TBAT). By combining a physical exam package with a powerful online analytics platform, we will provide an accessible and effective self-assessment tool. The platform's secondary goal is to serve as a high-quality lead generation engine for our future flagship product, the "Adaptive Learning System."

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary Users:** High school students in Chiang Mai and surrounding provinces who are preparing for the TBAT exam.

**Persona:**

- Motivated self-learners who need a reliable tool to gauge their current knowledge and readiness.
- Students who lack access to high-quality, in-person mock exam facilities, which are primarily located in Bangkok.
- They seek to identify specific academic weaknesses to focus their remaining study time effectively.

## 3. User Stories (Student-Facing Application)
