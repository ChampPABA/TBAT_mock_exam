## 📅 TIMELINE IMPACT ANALYSIS

### **Best Case** (All data received by next week)
```
Week 1: Replace mock content ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 
Week 2: Implement real APIs  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Week 3: Testing & QA         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Week 4: Launch 🚀
```

### **Current Reality** (Waiting for data)
```
Now:    Mock Implementation  ████████████░░░░░░░░ 60%
Week 1: Waiting...           ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 
Week 2: ???                  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
Week 3: ???                  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
```

### **Risk** ⚠️
```
- Each week of delay = 1 week pushed launch
- Design changes after implementation = 2x rework
- Content changes = Possible redesign needed
