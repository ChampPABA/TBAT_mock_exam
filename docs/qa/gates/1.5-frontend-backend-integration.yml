  CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED
  
  After initial PASS assessment, significant issues were discovered through the
  PO-ASSESSMENT-REQUEST.md document that reveal the current implementation is
  unsuitable for production deployment.
  
  The implementation was initially assessed as excellent, but subsequent discovery
  shows that temporary fixes were applied to resolve development issues that:
  
  1. VIOLATE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
     - AC1: 30-second auto-refresh disabled
     - AC4: Error resilience reduced (3→1 retries)  
     - AC7: Not production-ready due to fake data
  
  2. CREATE BUSINESS RISK:
     - Users receive inaccurate capacity information
     - Potential registration conflicts from stale data
     - Business credibility impact from unreliable system
  
  3. INTRODUCE HIGH TECHNICAL DEBT:
     - Mock system masquerading as real integration
     - Disabled functionality that must be re-enabled
     - Missing infrastructure dependencies
  
  GATE CHANGED FROM PASS TO FAIL
  
  The technical implementation quality remains high, but the functional
  compromises make this unsuitable for production deployment. Development
  team must either:
  
  Option 1: Implement full database integration (8 story points)
  Option 2: Enhanced mock system with simulated real-time (3 story points)
  Option 3: Infrastructure-first approach (5 story points)
  
  Re-review required after production blockers are resolved.
