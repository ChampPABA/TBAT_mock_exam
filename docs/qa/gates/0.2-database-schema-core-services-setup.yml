decision_rationale: |
  This infrastructure story represents exceptional implementation quality that establishes 
  a solid foundation for the TBAT Mock Exam Platform. The comprehensive database schema, 
  secure authentication system, professional payment integration, and Thai language support 
  all meet or exceed production standards. 
  
  The code demonstrates mature software engineering practices with proper error handling, 
  type safety, and architectural separation of concerns. All 6 acceptance criteria have been 
  fully implemented with attention to business requirements and security best practices.
  
  Gate status: PASS with commendation for outstanding technical execution.
