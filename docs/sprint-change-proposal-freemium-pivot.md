# Sprint Change Proposal - Freemium Model Pivot v5.0

**Document Type:** Sprint Change Proposal  
**Project:** TBAT Mock Exam Registration & Results Portal  
**Date:** 2025-01-03  
**Author:** John (Product Manager)  
**Reviewer:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - Strategic pivot from BoxSet code distribution to Freemium model for the **registration and results portal** supporting a **physical, paper-based exam** in Chiang Mai. This change affects only the registration process and results access tiers - NOT the exam format, which remains 100% offline at a physical venue.

### üéØ Confirmed Scope
- **System Type:** Registration and results portal ONLY
- **Exam Format:** Physical, paper-based at Chiang Mai venue
- **Timeline:** 14 days (70% simpler than originally scoped)
- **Start Date:** Immediate upon team notification

## ‚úÖ SCOPE CONFIRMATION

### What This System IS (APPROVED):
- **Registration Portal**: Online registration for physical exam at Chiang Mai venue
- **Results Portal**: View scores after offline grading of paper-based exam
- **Payment System**: Process ‡∏ø690 for VVIP package (3 subjects + detailed analysis)

### What This System IS NOT (CONFIRMED):
- ‚ùå **NOT an online exam platform** - Exam is 100% physical/paper-based
- ‚ùå **NOT a learning management system** - No study materials or practice tests
- ‚ùå **NOT real-time scoring** - Results uploaded after manual grading

### Physical Exam Details (CONFIRMED):
- **Date**: September 20, 2025
- **Location**: Chiang Mai University (or designated venue)
- **Format**: Traditional paper-based exam with answer sheets
- **Subjects**: Physics, Chemistry, Biology
- **Grading**: Offline by instructors, results uploaded to system

### Current State vs. Desired State

| Aspect | Current State (BoxSet) | Desired State (Freemium) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| User Acquisition | Purchase BoxSet with exam code | Free online registration for physical exam |
| Revenue Model | One-time upfront payment | Freemium with upgrade for detailed results |
| Registration | Code required to register | No code needed, auto-generated |
| Exam Format | Physical exam at venue | Physical exam at venue (UNCHANGED) |
| Results Access | All users see full results | FREE: basic scores, VVIP: detailed analysis |
| Barrier to Entry | High (‡∏ø690 upfront) | None (free for 1 subject) |
| Conversion Path | N/A | Free ‚Üí VVIP (‡∏ø690) for 3 subjects + analysis |

## 2. Impact Analysis

### Business Impact Assessment

#### Positive Impacts
- **Market Expansion:** 10x potential user base with free tier
- **CAC Reduction:** Customer acquisition cost reduced by ~70%
- **LTV Increase:** Potential for recurring revenue and upsells
- **Data Collection:** Rich behavioral data for optimization
- **Viral Growth:** Free tier enables word-of-mouth marketing

#### Risks & Challenges
- **Conversion Uncertainty:** 15% target conversion rate unproven
- **Support Volume:** Potential increase in support requests
- **Competition:** Free tier may attract competitors
- **Revenue Timing:** Delayed revenue recognition vs. upfront

### Technical Impact Assessment

#### System Components Affected

**High Priority Changes:**
- Registration system - Remove code requirement, add subject selection
- Database schema - Store registrations for physical exam
- Payment integration - VVIP upgrade processing
- Results display - Tier-based access after exam grading

**Medium Priority Changes:**
- Pre-exam dashboard - Show ticket, venue info, schedule
- Email system - Registration confirmation, exam reminders
- Admin panel - Results CSV upload interface

**NOT NEEDED (Out of Scope):**
- Online exam interface - Physical exam only
- Question management - No online questions
- Real-time scoring - Offline grading only
- Practice tests - No online testing features

### Epic & Story Impact

#### Modified Existing Stories

| Story ID | Title | Current Status | Required Changes | Effort |
|----------|-------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| 1.1 | Registration | Done | Remove BoxSet validation, add Line ID, parent info | 3 days |
| 1.2 | Login | Done | Add tier-based routing and dashboards | 1 day |
| 1.3 | Security | Done | Enhance for payment processing | 1 day |

#### New Stories Required

| Story ID | Title | Priority | Description | Dependencies | Effort |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 0.1 | Database Migration & Backup | P0 | Safe migration with rollback procedures | None | 2 days |
| 1.3.1 | Payment Security Enhancement | P0 | Enhance security for payment processing | 1.3 | 1 day |
| 1.4 | Freemium Registration | P0 | Implement free tier registration with auto-code generation | 1.1, 0.1 | 3 days |

| 1.7 | Analytics Tracking | P1 | Conversion funnel metrics | 1.6 | 1 day |
| 1.8 | Email Notifications | P1 | Welcome, upgrade, results emails | 1.4 | 1 day |

## 3. Solution Approach

### Recommended Path: Direct Adjustment/Integration

**Rationale:** Modify existing implementation rather than complete rebuild
- Preserves valuable work already completed
- Realistic time to market (21 days with proper testing)
- Lower risk than complete system overhaul
- Maintains system stability with proper rollback procedures

### Technical Architecture Changes

#### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- New Code table structure
CREATE TABLE codes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  type ENUM('FREE', 'VVIP') NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('ACTIVE', 'UPGRADED', 'EXPIRED') DEFAULT 'ACTIVE',
  subject VARCHAR(20), -- Only for FREE codes
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  valid_until TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  upgraded_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Updated User table
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN line_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
ADD COLUMN tier ENUM('FREE', 'VVIP') DEFAULT 'FREE',
ADD COLUMN free_subject VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN parent_name VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN parent_relation VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN parent_phone VARCHAR(15),
ADD COLUMN parent_email VARCHAR(100);
```

#### System Architecture Flow

```
Pre-Exam Registration Flow:
1. User submits registration form (no code required)
2. Selects 1 subject (FREE) or pays for 3 subjects (VVIP)
3. System generates exam ticket/code
4. Confirmation email with exam details
5. User saves ticket for physical exam day

Physical Exam Day:
1. Student arrives at venue (Chiang Mai)
2. Shows ticket/code at registration desk
3. Takes paper-based exam
4. Submits answer sheet
5. Exam graded offline by instructors

Post-Exam Results Flow:
1. Admin uploads graded results CSV
2. Students notified via email/Line
3. Enter code on website
4. FREE users see basic scores
5. VVIP users see detailed analysis
6. FREE users can upgrade to see full details
```

### Database Migrations with Safety Procedures

```sql
-- Migration 000: Create backup tables (CRITICAL - RUN FIRST)
CREATE TABLE users_backup_v3 AS SELECT * FROM users;
CREATE TABLE codes_backup_v3 AS SELECT * FROM codes WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM codes LIMIT 1);

-- Migration 001: Add tier system
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN line_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
ADD COLUMN tier VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'FREE',
ADD COLUMN free_subject VARCHAR(20);

-- Migration 002: Add parent info
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN parent_name VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN parent_relation VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN parent_phone VARCHAR(15),
ADD COLUMN parent_email VARCHAR(100);

-- Migration 003: Create new codes table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS codes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ACTIVE',
  subject VARCHAR(20),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  valid_until TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  upgraded_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Migration 004: Add indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_codes_user_id ON codes(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_codes_status ON codes(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_tier ON users(tier);

-- Rollback Script (Keep separately)
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS codes;
-- ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS line_id, tier, free_subject, parent_name, parent_relation, parent_phone, parent_email;
-- INSERT INTO users SELECT * FROM users_backup_v3;
```
