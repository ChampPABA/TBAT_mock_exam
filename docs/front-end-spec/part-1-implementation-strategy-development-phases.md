# Part 1: Implementation Strategy & Development Phases

### 1.1 Mock-First Development Approach

**Phase 1: Mock Data UI Development (Weeks 1-2)**
- Complete UI implementation with mock data and services
- No external dependencies or database requirements
- Full user journey testing with realistic sample data
- Component library establishment with shadcn/ui
- Comprehensive testing framework setup

**Phase 2: Database Integration & Production (Weeks 3-4)**
- PostgreSQL database integration with Prisma
- API endpoint development and authentication
- External service integration (Resend email)
- Production deployment to Vercel with CI/CD
- Performance optimization and monitoring
