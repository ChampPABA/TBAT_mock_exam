# Part 8: Production Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

### 8.1 Deployment Strategy (Vercel + GitHub Actions)

#### Deployment Platform Selection
- **Primary Platform:** Vercel (optimized for Next.js applications)
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (serverless, automatic scaling)
- **Email Service:** Resend (reliable delivery, developer-friendly)
- **Version Control:** GitHub with automated workflows

#### Environment Configuration
- **Development:** Local Docker setup with hot reload and mock services
- **Staging:** Cloud-hosted with production-like configuration and test data
- **Production:** Optimized build with CDN, database scaling, and monitoring

### 8.2 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Vercel
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, staging]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Test suite execution (Vitest + Playwright)
      - TypeScript type checking
      - ESLint and Prettier validation
      - Security vulnerability scanning
      
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Next.js optimization and bundling
      - Asset optimization and CDN preparation
      - Environment-specific configuration
      
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Automatic staging deployment
      - Smoke tests and health checks
      - Production deployment (manual approval)
      - Rollback capability
```

#### Quality Gates & Automation
- **Minimum 85% code coverage** requirement
- **All tests must pass** before merge to main branch
- **TypeScript strict mode** with zero errors
- **ESLint + Prettier** rules satisfied
- **Accessibility tests** must pass (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Performance budget** enforcement (< 250KB gzipped)

### 8.3 Environment Management & Security

#### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables:** Managed through Vercel dashboard
- **Secret Management:** No secrets in repository, encrypted at rest
- **Database Connections:** Connection pooling and SSL enforcement
- **API Keys:** Secure storage with automatic rotation support

#### Security Configuration
- HTTPS enforcement with automatic SSL certificates
- CORS configuration for API endpoints
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### 8.4 Monitoring & Analytics

#### Application Monitoring Stack
- **Performance:** Vercel Analytics (Core Web Vitals, page load times)
- **Error Tracking:** Built-in Vercel error reporting + custom error boundaries
- **Database Monitoring:** Neon dashboard (query performance, connection pooling)
- **Uptime Monitoring:** Vercel status page + custom health checks

#### User Analytics & Metrics
- **Engagement Tracking:** User registration, exam completion rates
- **Performance Metrics:** Page load times, API response times
- **Business Metrics:** Activation rates, lead generation
- **Error Rates:** Client-side and server-side error tracking
