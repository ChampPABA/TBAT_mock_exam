# Introduction

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas
- **High School Students (Primary)**: ม.4-ม.6 students in Chiang Mai preparing for TBAT medical school entrance exams. Tech-savvy mobile-first users who need accessible, stress-free exam experiences.
- **Parents/Guardians (Secondary)**: Supportive parents who help coordinate exam registration and follow their children's progress. Prefer clear communication and reliable updates.
- **Tutoring Center Administrators (Tertiary)**: Professionals managing 200+ students during exam periods who need efficient oversight and real-time enrollment monitoring.

#### Usability Goals
- **Ease of learning**: New users can complete registration and understand the freemium model within 3 minutes
- **Efficiency of use**: Returning users can check results and upgrade packages within 30 seconds
- **Error prevention**: Clear validation and confirmation for all critical actions (payment, exam registration)
- **Memorability**: Infrequent users can return after weeks without relearning the interface
- **Mobile optimization**: 80%+ of interactions occur on mobile devices - seamless responsive experience

#### Design Principles
1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize clear communication over aesthetic innovation, especially for exam-critical information
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed. Hide advanced analytics behind upgrade walls
3. **Consistent patterns** - Use familiar Thai educational UI patterns throughout the application
4. **Immediate feedback** - Every action has clear, immediate response with toast notifications
5. **Accessible by default** - Design for all users from the start with proper Thai language support
