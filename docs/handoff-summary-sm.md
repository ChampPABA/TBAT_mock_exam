## 🎯 Next Steps for SM

### **Immediate Actions (Next Sprint Planning)**

1. **Story Creation Priority:**
   - **Story 2.3:** Database Schema Creation (High Priority)
   - **Story 2.4:** Backend API Implementation (High Priority)
   - **Story 2.5:** Frontend-Backend Integration (High Priority)

2. **Epic Sequencing:**
   - Epic 2 Stories 2.3-2.5 can start immediately
   - Epic 3 (Payment) can run parallel to Epic 2
   - Epic 4 (Session Backend) depends on Epic 2 completion

### **Story Creation Guidelines**

**For Story 2.3 (Database Schema):**
- Focus on User table supporting complete registration form data
- Include ExamCode table with package/subject/session relationships
- Add SessionCapacity table for real-time capacity management

**For Story 2.4 (Backend API):**
- POST /api/auth/register endpoint for complete registration flow
- GET /api/session/capacity for real-time session availability
- POST /api/examcode/generate for unique code creation

**For Story 2.5 (Integration):**
- Connect completed frontend with live backend APIs
- End-to-end testing from registration form to database storage
- Error handling for all registration failure scenarios
