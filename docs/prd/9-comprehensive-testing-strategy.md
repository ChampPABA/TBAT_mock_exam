# 9. Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Testing Framework Selection & Setup

**Testing Stack:**
- **Unit Testing:** Vitest (faster than Jest, better Vite integration)
- **Component Testing:** React Testing Library with Vitest
- **Integration Testing:** Playwright for API endpoints
- **End-to-End Testing:** Playwright for critical user journeys
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript strict mode with 100% type coverage target

**Test Environment Setup:**
- Separate test database (PostgreSQL in Docker)
- Mock services for external APIs (Phase 1)
- Test data factories with Prisma
- Parallel test execution for faster CI/CD

### 9.2 Phase-Aligned Testing Strategy

**Phase 1 Testing (Mock Data):**
- Component unit tests with mock data
- User interface integration tests
- Mock service validation
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Responsive design testing

**Phase 2 Testing (Database Integration):**
- Database operation tests
- API endpoint integration tests
- Authentication flow testing
- External service integration tests
- End-to-end user journey tests

### 9.3 Testing Requirements & Coverage

**Core Test Coverage Areas:**
- **Authentication Flows:** Login, registration, password reset, session management
- **Answer Submission:** Input validation, grading logic, result calculation
- **Admin Panel:** User management, code generation, analytics dashboard
- **Database Operations:** CRUD operations, data integrity, migration testing
- **API Endpoints:** Input validation, error handling, response formatting
- **UI Components:** Rendering, interaction, accessibility, responsive behavior

**Quality Gates & CI/CD Integration:**
- **Minimum 85% code coverage** (increased from 80%)
- **All tests must pass** before merge to main branch
- **TypeScript strict mode** with zero errors
- **ESLint + Prettier** rules satisfied
- **Accessibility tests** must pass
- **Performance budget** enforcement

**Testing Automation:**
- Pre-commit hooks run unit tests
- Pull request triggers full test suite
- Staging deployment runs E2E tests
- Production deployment requires manual approval after tests
