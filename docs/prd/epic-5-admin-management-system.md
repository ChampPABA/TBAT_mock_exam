# Epic 5: Admin Management System

**Goal:** Provide comprehensive admin interface for xlsx score upload, student data export, capacity monitoring, and exam operations management.

### Story 5.1: UI/UX Mockup Implementation

As a **UX Expert**,
I want to create admin interface mockups focused on operational efficiency,
so that administrators can manage exam operations quickly and effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Admin dashboard mockup with key metrics: total registrations, Free/Advanced breakdown, session capacity status

**AC2:** Excel upload interface mockup with drag-drop area, file validation feedback, and upload progress indicators

**AC3:** Student data export mockup with filters (session, package type, date range) and download options

**AC4:** Capacity management mockup with real-time session monitoring and manual override capabilities

**AC5:** Score management mockup showing uploaded results with edit/delete capabilities and error handling

**AC6:** Mobile-responsive admin design for exam day operations using tablets/phones

### Story 5.2: Frontend Development with Mock Data

As a **Frontend Developer**,
I want to build admin components using mock student and score data,
so that the admin interface is fully functional before backend integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Admin dashboard component with mock metrics and real-time updating counters

**AC2:** File upload component with drag-drop functionality and mock xlsx processing

**AC3:** Data table component for student management with sorting, filtering, and pagination

**AC4:** Export functionality component generating mock xlsx files with student data

**AC5:** Score editing interface with inline editing and batch operations

**AC6:** Capacity monitoring component with session status and manual capacity adjustment controls

### Story 5.3: Database Schema Creation

As a **Backend Developer**,
I want to create admin operations and audit tables,
so that all administrative actions are tracked and student data is properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Admin_User table created with role-based permissions and secure authentication

**AC2:** Score_Upload table tracking all xlsx uploads with filename, timestamp, processed_records

**AC3:** Data_Export table logging all export requests with filters and download timestamps

**AC4:** Capacity_Override table tracking manual capacity adjustments with admin_id and reason

**AC5:** Admin_Audit table recording all administrative actions for compliance and debugging

**AC6:** Exam_Results table structure optimized for bulk insert operations from xlsx imports

### Story 5.4: Backend API Implementation

As a **Backend Developer**,  
I want to create admin-specific APIs for file processing, PDF management, and comprehensive data management,
so that admin operations work efficiently with proper validation and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** POST /api/admin/scores/upload endpoint processing xlsx files with validation and error reporting

**AC2:** POST /api/admin/pdf/upload endpoint for PDF solution upload with metadata and automated user notifications

**AC3:** GET /api/admin/export/students endpoint generating xlsx files with applied filters

**AC4:** GET /api/admin/dashboard/metrics endpoint providing real-time registration and capacity statistics

**AC5:** PUT /api/admin/capacity/override endpoint for manual session capacity adjustments

**AC6:** CRUD /api/admin/users/\* endpoints for comprehensive user management including profile updates and exam code regeneration

**AC7:** GET /api/admin/audit/logs endpoint for administrative action tracking and compliance

**AC8:** Rate limiting and authentication middleware protecting all admin endpoints from unauthorized access

### Story 5.5: Frontend-Backend Integration

As a **Full-Stack Developer**,
I want to connect admin frontend with live file processing and data management APIs,
so that administrators can efficiently manage exam operations with real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Excel upload working end-to-end from file selection through score processing and validation reporting

**AC2:** Student data export generating actual xlsx files with current database information

**AC3:** Real-time dashboard metrics displaying live registration counts and capacity status

**AC4:** Capacity override functionality working with immediate database updates and audit logging

**AC5:** Admin audit logs displaying actual administrative actions with proper timestamps and user tracking

**AC6:** Complete admin workflow testing covering score upload, data export, and capacity management operations
