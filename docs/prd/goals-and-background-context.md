### Background Context

High school students in Northern Thailand face significant disadvantages preparing for TBAT (Thai Biomedical Admissions Test), with most high-quality mock exams centralized in Bangkok, requiring costly travel and accommodation. This creates a clear market gap where 200+ annual students in Chiang Mai region lack access to realistic, paper-based mock exams that simulate actual test conditions.

The TBAT Mock Exam Platform addresses this gap through a unique hybrid model combining physical exam events with advanced digital analytics. Students register online for a scheduled physical mock exam on 27 กันยายน 2568 (8 days before the real TBAT on 5 ตุลาคม 2568), take paper-based exams in formal timed settings, then access comprehensive performance analytics online within 48 hours. This approach leverages ASPECT organization's credibility (previous Dentorium Camp organizer), government support (STeP, Deepa, Startup Thailand), and Olympic วิชาการ certified reviewers to create the most realistic and valuable TBAT preparation experience available outside Bangkok.
