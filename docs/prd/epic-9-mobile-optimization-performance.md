**AC2:** Mobile navigation optimization with thumb-friendly controls and single-hand operation

**AC3:** Loading state designs optimized for slower 3G connections common in Thailand

**AC4:** Performance dashboard mockup for admin monitoring of system health and user experience

**AC5:** Offline functionality mockup showing cached content and sync indicators

**AC6:** Cross-browser compatibility testing interface for monitoring device/browser performance

### Story 9.2: Frontend Development with Mock Data

As a **Frontend Developer**,
I want to implement PWA capabilities and mobile optimizations,
so that the platform provides app-like experience with reliable performance across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Progressive Web App implementation with service worker, manifest, and offline functionality

**AC2:** Performance optimizations including code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization

**AC3:** Mobile-specific optimizations for touch interactions, viewport handling, and keyboard behavior

**AC4:** Loading performance improvements with skeleton states and progressive enhancement

**AC5:** Cross-browser compatibility testing automation for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge

**AC6:** Performance monitoring dashboard for real-time user experience tracking

### Story 9.3: Database Schema Creation

As a **Backend Developer**,
I want to create performance monitoring and analytics tables,
so that system performance can be tracked and optimized based on real user data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Performance_Metrics table storing page load times, API response times, and user experience data

**AC2:** Browser_Analytics table tracking device types, browsers, and performance across different configurations

**AC3:** Error_Tracking table logging client-side errors, performance issues, and system failures

**AC4:** User_Sessions table monitoring session duration, bounce rates, and engagement patterns

**AC5:** System_Health table tracking uptime, response times, and service availability

**AC6:** Performance_Alerts table managing automated alerts for performance degradation

### Story 9.4: Backend API Implementation

As a **Backend Developer**,
I want to create performance monitoring and optimization APIs,
so that system performance can be measured and maintained at exam-critical levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Performance monitoring APIs collecting Core Web Vitals and user experience metrics

**AC2:** Health check endpoints for all critical services with automated alerting

**AC3:** Caching optimization with Redis for frequently accessed data and API responses

**AC4:** Database query optimization with connection pooling and performance monitoring

**AC5:** CDN integration for static assets with geographic optimization for Thailand

**AC6:** Load balancing and auto-scaling configuration for handling 300+ concurrent users

### Story 9.5: Frontend-Backend Integration

As a **Full-Stack Developer**,
I want to integrate all performance optimizations with live monitoring,
so that the platform consistently delivers < 2 second load times and 99.9% uptime during critical periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Complete PWA functionality working with offline capabilities and app-like experience

**AC2:** Performance targets achieved: < 2 second mobile load times, 99.9% uptime during registration/results periods

**AC3:** Real-time performance monitoring with automated alerts and error recovery

**AC4:** Cross-browser compatibility validated across 95%+ of target devices and browsers

**AC5:** Load testing verification supporting 300+ concurrent users during peak registration

**AC6:** Complete system optimization ready for 27 กันยายน 2568 launch with full performance monitoring
