# 10. Production Deployment & Infrastructure

### 10.1 Deployment Platform & Strategy

**Selected Platform:** Vercel + Neon PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Vercel (seamless Next.js integration, global CDN)
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (serverless, automatic scaling)
- **Email Service:** Resend (developer-friendly, reliable delivery)

**Deployment Pipeline (GitHub Actions + Vercel):**
1. **Code Push:** Triggers automated build process
2. **Quality Gates:** 
   - Run full test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
   - TypeScript type checking
   - ESLint and Prettier validation
   - Security vulnerability scanning
3. **Build Process:** 
   - Next.js optimization and bundling
   - Asset optimization and CDN preparation
   - Environment-specific configuration
4. **Staging Deployment:** 
   - Automatic deployment to staging environment
   - Smoke tests and health checks
5. **Production Deployment:** 
   - Manual approval gate
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Rollback capability

### 10.2 Environment Configuration & Management

**Environment Tiers:**
- **Development:** Local Docker setup with hot reload and mock services
- **Staging:** Cloud-hosted with production-like configuration and test data
- **Production:** Optimized build with CDN, database scaling, and monitoring

**Configuration Management:**
- **Environment Variables:** Managed through Vercel dashboard
- **Secret Management:** No secrets in repository, encrypted at rest
- **Database Connections:** Connection pooling and SSL enforcement
- **API Keys:** Secure storage with automatic rotation support

**Security Configuration:**
- HTTPS enforcement with automatic SSL certificates
- CORS configuration for API endpoints
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### 10.3 Monitoring, Analytics & Performance

**Application Monitoring Stack:**
- **Performance:** Vercel Analytics (Core Web Vitals, page load times)
- **Error Tracking:** Built-in Vercel error reporting + custom error boundaries
- **Database Monitoring:** Neon dashboard (query performance, connection pooling)
- **Uptime Monitoring:** Vercel status page + custom health checks

**User Analytics & Metrics:**
- **Engagement Tracking:** User registration, exam completion rates
- **Performance Metrics:** Page load times, API response times
- **Business Metrics:** Activation rates, lead generation
- **Error Rates:** Client-side and server-side error tracking

**System Health Dashboards:**
- Real-time application performance metrics
- Database query performance and optimization recommendations
- User engagement and conversion funnel analysis
- Error rate trends and alert thresholds
