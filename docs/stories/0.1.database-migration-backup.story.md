# Story 0.1: Database Migration & Backup

**Epic:** Epic 0: Freemium Migration Foundation  
**Story:** 0.1 - Database Migration & Backup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to safely migrate the database schema from BoxSet to Freemium model with complete backup procedures,  
**so that** we can support tier-based registration and results access without data loss risk.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete database backup procedures are implemented and tested
2. Rollback scripts are prepared and can restore the system within 30 minutes
3. New Freemium schema fields are added without breaking existing functionality

5. Database indexes are optimized for tier-based queries
6. Backup verification confirms 100% data integrity
7. Migration can be executed during a 2-hour maintenance window
8. Monitoring alerts are configured for migration health checks

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Changes
[Source: docs/architecture/migration-to-freemium.md#Phase-1]

#### New User Fields (Non-Breaking Additions)
```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS line_id VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tier VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'FREE',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS free_subject VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS parent_name VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS parent_relation VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS parent_phone VARCHAR(15),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS parent_email VARCHAR(100);
```

#### New Registration Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS registrations_v2 (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  exam_ticket VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  tier VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  subjects JSON NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'REGISTERED',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Backup Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/migration-to-freemium.md#Phase-0]

Create timestamped backup before any changes:
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA backup_20250103;
CREATE TABLE backup_20250103.users AS SELECT * FROM public.users;
CREATE TABLE backup_20250103.codes AS SELECT * FROM public.codes;
CREATE TABLE backup_20250103.registrations AS SELECT * FROM public.registrations;
```

### Migration Data Flow
[Source: docs/sprint-change-proposal-freemium-pivot.md#Section-3]

1. All existing BoxSet users automatically receive VVIP tier
2. Existing code validations preserved for backward compatibility
3. New users can register without codes (FREE tier)
4. Exam tickets generated for all registrations

### Rollback Triggers
[Source: docs/architecture/migration-to-freemium.md#Rollback-Plan]

Automatic rollback if:
- Migration error rate > 2%
- Data integrity check fails
- Migration time exceeds 2 hours
- System health check fails post-migration

### File Locations
- Migration scripts: `/scripts/migration/`
- Backup scripts: `/scripts/backup/`
- Rollback procedures: `/scripts/rollback/`
- SQL migrations: `/prisma/migrations/`

### Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `DATABASE_BACKUP_URL`: Backup database connection
- `MIGRATION_MODE`: 'dry-run' | 'execute'
