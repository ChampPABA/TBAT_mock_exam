# Story 1.3: Registration Security Enhancement

**Epic:** Epic 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure  
**Story:** 1.3 - Registration Security Enhancement

## Status

✅ **Done**

## Story

**As a** new user,  
**I want** to validate my unique Box Set code first in a secure modal before entering personal information,  
**so that** I can quickly verify code validity without wasting time on invalid codes and ensure secure registration with enhanced code protection.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User clicks "ใส่รหัส Box Set" button and sees code verification modal
2. Modal allows entry of TBAT-XXXX-XXXX format codes with real-time format validation
3. System validates unique code exists, hasn't been used, and provides immediate feedback
4. Invalid/used codes show clear error messages with recovery options
5. Valid codes automatically close modal and proceed to multi-step registration wizard
6. Registration wizard shows progress indicator (Step 1: Personal Info, Step 2: Academic Info)
7. Multi-step form has auto-save functionality and proper navigation
8. Form applies Variant 6 design system with medical green theme and Thai typography
9. All components are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with proper Thai text support
10. Registration completion activates the code and creates user account securely
11. Success page displays celebration with auto-redirect to dashboard
