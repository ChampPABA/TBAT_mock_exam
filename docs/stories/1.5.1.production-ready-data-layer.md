# Story 1.5.1: Production-Ready Data Layer with Database Integration

## Status

In Development - Database Integration Phase (Tasks 6-8 Pending)

## Story

**As a** Full-Stack Developer,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 1.5 Implementation State**: All Story 1.5 acceptance criteria completed with enhanced mock system operational, but critical production-blocking issue discovered post-implementation. The useCapacity hook is **EMERGENCY DISABLED** (enabled: false, refetchInterval: 0) at lines 29-30 to prevent infinite API calls that were generating thousands of requests per minute. Real-time updates are temporarily offline.

**Critical Files Status** (VERIFIED):
- `apps/web/hooks/useCapacity.ts:29-30` - Hook EMERGENCY DISABLED: `enabled: false, refetchInterval: 0`
- `apps/web/app/api/capacity/route.ts` - Enhanced mock system operational (±3 people/30s variation)
- `CRITICAL-API-SPAM-ISSUE.md` - Documents infinite loop root cause analysis with React Strict Mode
- `apps/web/hooks/useOnlineStatus.ts` - Available for offline detection integration
- `apps/web/lib/client-cache.ts` - Available for enhanced caching strategy
- `apps/web/lib/monitoring-client.ts` - Available for circuit breaker metrics integration

[Source: docs/stories/1.5.frontend-backend-integration.md, CRITICAL-API-SPAM-ISSUE.md]

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]

**React & Next.js 14+ Patterns**:
- Custom hooks with proper useEffect dependency management
- React Strict Mode compatibility for development environments
- Next.js API Routes with proper error handling and rate limiting
- TypeScript 5.0+ for type safety in hook implementations

**Performance & Monitoring**:
- Vercel Analytics integration for real-time performance tracking
- Jest 29+ for comprehensive hook testing with React Testing Library
- Playwright for end-to-end testing of real-time update scenarios

### Data Models & API Integration

[Source: docs/architecture/section-4-data-models.md, docs/stories/1.5.frontend-backend-integration.md]

**API Endpoint Structure** (Working):
```typescript
// GET /api/capacity?format=detailed
interface CapacityData {
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00";
  current_count: number;
  max_capacity: number; // 300 exam participants per session
  availability_status: "AVAILABLE" | "NEARLY_FULL" | "FULL" | "ADVANCED_ONLY";
  thai_message: string; // Localized capacity messaging
}
```

**Hook Interface** (Needs Fixing):
```typescript
interface UseCapacityHook {
  data: CapacityData[] | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
  refetch: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issues Identified**:
1. **React Strict Mode**: Development double-mounting creating multiple hook instances
2. **useEffect Dependencies**: Object recreations causing infinite dependency cycles  
3. **Global Interval Management**: Race conditions between multiple hook instances
4. **Instance ID Conflicts**: Multiple components creating competing intervals

**Current Workaround Applied**: Complete hook disabling (enabled: false) stops all real-time functionality

### File Structure & Integration Points

**Files Requiring Fixes**:
- `apps/web/hooks/useCapacity.ts` - PRIMARY: Fix infinite loop and re-enable (Line 29-30)
- `apps/web/hooks/useOnlineStatus.ts` - ENHANCE: Better offline detection
- `apps/web/lib/monitoring-client.ts` - ADD: Circuit breaker metrics tracking

**Files Working Correctly**:
- `apps/web/app/api/capacity/route.ts` - Enhanced mock with realistic variation ✅
- `apps/web/components/landing/hero-section.tsx` - Ready for real-time updates ✅
- `apps/web/components/landing/pricing-section.tsx` - Package selection logic ready ✅

### Business Logic Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture/section-4-data-models.md#business-logic]

**Production Requirements**:
- **30-second Polling**: Must be stable without infinite loops
- **Circuit Breaker**: 3 consecutive failures trigger fallback mode
- **Capacity Messaging**: Hide exact Free counts, show "เต็มแล้ว" appropriately
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms response times with proper caching
- **Thai Language**: All error messages and notifications in Thai

### Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation

**State Machine Required**:
```typescript
type CircuitBreakerState = "CLOSED" | "OPEN" | "HALF_OPEN";

interface CircuitBreakerConfig {
  failureThreshold: number; // 3 consecutive failures
  recoveryTimeout: number;  // 60 seconds before health check
  healthCheckInterval: number; // 30 seconds between checks
}
```

**Integration Points**:
- Hook state management with circuit breaker logic
- Fallback to enhanced mock system when circuit is OPEN
- Health check integration with existing API monitoring
- User notification system for degraded service mode

### Enhanced Error Handling Strategy

**Error Categories**:
1. **Network Errors**: Timeout, connectivity issues → Circuit breaker activation
2. **API Errors**: HTTP 4xx/5xx → Exponential backoff retry
3. **Parse Errors**: Invalid JSON response → Fallback to mock data
4. **Component Errors**: React error boundaries → Graceful degradation

**User Experience Requirements**:
- Thai language error messages with clear recovery actions
- Loading states that don't flash or flicker during polling
- Manual refresh options when automatic updates fail
- Offline mode detection with appropriate messaging

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing Focus**:
- Hook stability under React Strict Mode conditions
- Circuit breaker state transitions and failure detection
- Retry logic with exponential backoff validation
- Global interval management and cleanup verification

**Integration Testing Requirements**:
- API failure scenario simulation and recovery testing
- Load testing with 20 concurrent users (production requirement)
- Real-time polling behavior validation
- Error boundary integration testing
