- Comprehensive Thai localization with proper error messages
- Well-structured component architecture and TypeScript usage
- Proper accessibility implementation (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Mobile-first responsive design implementation
- Comprehensive test suite design (639+ lines across 4 test files)

**Critical Issues:**
- **SECURITY BREACH**: Authentication tokens stored in localStorage (highly vulnerable to XSS attacks)
- **SECURITY BREACH**: Plaintext password storage in mock services
- **BLOCKER**: Dependency conflicts prevent test execution (React 19 vs lucide-react peer dependency)

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed due to blocking security issues that require fundamental architecture changes.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ⚠️ Good TypeScript/React patterns, but security standards violated
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Excellent Turborepo monorepo implementation  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Tests exist but cannot execute due to dependency conflicts
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria functionally implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Security Fixes Required:**
- [ ] Replace localStorage token storage with HTTP-only secure cookies (RegistrationForm.tsx:124)
- [ ] Implement password hashing in mock services to match production patterns (auth.ts:70)
- [ ] Fix React 19 compatibility issues with lucide-react dependency
- [ ] Resolve vitest dependency conflicts to enable test execution

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Add CSRF protection to registration endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Add input sanitization for user data
- [ ] Add audit logging for registration attempts

### Security Review

**CRITICAL SECURITY FAILURES IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Token Storage Vulnerability (HIGH RISK)**: 
   - Tokens stored in localStorage are accessible to any script, making them vulnerable to XSS attacks
   - **Impact**: Complete account takeover risk
   - **Required Action**: Implement HTTP-only secure cookies immediately

2. **Password Storage (HIGH RISK)**:
   - Plaintext password storage even in mock services creates bad patterns
   - **Impact**: Poor security practices that could leak into production
   - **Required Action**: Hash passwords with bcrypt even in mock implementation

3. **Missing CSRF Protection (MEDIUM RISK)**:
   - Registration endpoints lack CSRF token validation
   - **Impact**: Cross-site request forgery attacks possible
   - **Required Action**: Implement CSRF tokens

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Implementation: GOOD**
- Real-time validation with appropriate debouncing (3+ characters for code validation)
