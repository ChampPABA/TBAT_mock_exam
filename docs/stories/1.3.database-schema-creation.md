## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.2 completed comprehensive frontend components for package selection and capacity display. The database schema must now support real-time capacity tracking that these components expect through mock data interfaces.

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Vercel Postgres for serverless hosting
- **ORM**: Prisma 5.0+ for type-safe database queries and migrations
- **Deployment**: Vercel platform with integrated database management
- **Package Manager**: npm 9.0+ for dependency management

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/section-4-data-models.md]

Key models to implement:

```typescript
interface SessionCapacity {
  id: string;
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00";
  current_count: number;
  max_capacity: number; // 300 exam participants per session (system serves 20 concurrent users)
  exam_date: Date; // 27 กันยายน 2568
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}

interface User {
  package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED"; // Current package level
  is_upgraded: boolean; // Track upgrade status
}

interface ExamCode {
  user_id: string; // Foreign key to User
  package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED";
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00";
}
```

### Database Schema Implementation

[Source: architecture/section-4-data-models.md#database-relationships]

Primary relationships to implement:
- User → ExamCode (1:many) - Users can have multiple exam codes
- User → Payment (1:many) - Users can make multiple purchases
- SessionCapacity → User (many:many through User_Package)

Business logic constraints:
- Free users: Maximum 1 ExamCode per registration
- Advanced users: 3 ExamCodes (one per subject)
- Session capacity: 600 total exam participants (300 × 2 sessions on 27 กันยายน 2568)
- Free package limit: 150 per session (300 total Free capacity)

### File Structure

Based on existing Next.js project structure:
- `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma` - Main database schema
- `apps/web/prisma/migrations/` - Database migration files
- `apps/web/prisma/seed.ts` - Initial data seeding
- `apps/web/lib/prisma.ts` - Prisma client configuration

### Security Considerations

- **Data Integrity**: Enforce foreign key constraints for user-package relationships
- **Capacity Validation**: Prevent overselling through database constraints
- **Audit Trail**: Track capacity changes for debugging and monitoring
- **PDPA Compliance**: Include consent tracking in User model
- **Session Security**: Validate session time selections against available slots

### Important Notes

- Database schema must align with existing mock data interfaces from Story 1.2
- Capacity tracking requires real-time updates for accurate availability display
- Schema should support both current 20-user capacity and future 300-user scaling
- All timestamp fields should use Thai timezone (UTC+7) considerations

### Frontend Integration Compatibility

✅ **Complete Support Achieved**: The database schema now supports 100% of frontend requirements:

1. **Package Selection Components**: Package model with pricing, features, and availability status
2. **Session Capacity Display**: SessionCapacity and CapacityStatus models for real-time tracking
3. **Registration Forms**: User model with complete personal and parent information fields
4. **User-Package Relationships**: UserPackage junction table for session selections

### Parent Information Support

✅ **Added in Version 1.4**: Database now captures parent/guardian information:
- `parentName` (String?) - ชื่อผู้ปกครอง (optional field)
- `parentPhone` (String?) - เบอร์ติดต่อผู้ปกครอง (optional field)

This ensures complete data collection for student registration as required by the frontend forms.

### Capacity Logic Clarification

**Two Distinct Concepts:**

1. **Exam Participants (600 total):**
   - People taking physical exam on 27 กันยายน 2568
   - Morning: 300 participants (09:00-12:00)
   - Afternoon: 300 participants (13:00-16:00)
   - Post-exam: Will access platform for PDF solutions & analytics

2. **Concurrent System Users (20 max):**
   - Peak registration load: 20 simultaneous users
   - System architecture optimized for 20 concurrent connections
   - Database handles 20 simultaneous transactions

**Database Implementation:**
- `SessionCapacity.max_capacity = 300` (exam participants per session)
- `SessionCapacity.current_count` tracks registrations (0-300)
- Platform serves 20 concurrent users during registration periods

## Testing

### Unit Testing

[Source: architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md#quality-assurance]

- **Framework**: Jest 29+ for database model testing
- **Test Location**: `apps/web/__tests__/prisma/` directory
- **Coverage Requirements**: All Prisma models and relationships tested
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - Model creation and validation
  - Foreign key constraint enforcement
  - Capacity calculation logic
  - Migration up/down procedures

### Database Testing

- **Framework**: Jest with Prisma test environment
- **Test Database**: Separate test database for isolation
- **Critical Test Cases**:
  1. Package creation with correct pricing and features
  2. Session capacity tracking with Free/Advanced limits
  3. User-Package relationship constraints
  4. Capacity status real-time updates
  5. Database index performance validation
  6. Migration rollback safety

### Integration Testing

- **Database Connection**: Test Prisma client connectivity
- **Seed Data**: Validate initial data population
- **Performance**: Test capacity query performance under load
- **Constraints**: Verify all business logic constraints

### Test Commands

```bash
npm run db:generate     # Generate Prisma types
npm run db:migrate      # Run database migrations
npm run db:seed         # Populate initial data
npm run test:db         # Run database-specific tests
npm run db:reset        # Reset database for testing
```
