## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 1.2.1 Completion Status**: Registration and session selection frontend is **COMPLETED** with full UI implementation. The frontend includes:

- ✅ Multi-step registration form with password fields (email as username)
- ✅ Session time selection (09:00-12:00 / 13:00-16:00) with capacity display
- ✅ Package selection integration (Free/Advanced)
- ✅ PDPA consent checkbox with Thai language support
- ✅ Complete form validation with Thai error messages
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design following TBAT design system

[Source: docs/stories/1.2.1.registration-session-selection-enhancement.md]

The database schema must support all frontend data capture from Story 1.2.1 implementation.

### Data Models Architecture

**✅ ARCHITECTURE-ALIGNED: Denormalized User Schema (Authoritative):**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // UUID primary key
  email: string; // Unique identifier (serves as username)
  password_hash: string; // Hashed password (8+ chars, letters+numbers)
  thai_name: string; // Thai display name from frontend
  phone: string; // Contact number from registration
  school: string; // High school name selection
  line_id?: string; // Optional LINE contact
  package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED"; // Package selection from frontend
  is_upgraded: boolean; // Track upgrade status
  pdpa_consent: boolean; // GDPR compliance checkbox
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

**⚠️ NOTE**: This denormalized approach consolidates all user data in a single table as specified in `docs/architecture/section-4-data-models.md:10-23`, eliminating the need for separate User_Profile and User_Package tables.

interface UserSession {
  id: string;
  user_id: string; // Foreign key to User
  session_token: string; // NextAuth.js session management
  expires_at: Date; // 7-day expiry for security
  created_at: Date;
}
```

**✅ ARCHITECTURE-ALIGNED: ExamCode Integration Schema:**

ExamCode table handles exam registration linking (replaces User_Package table):

```typescript
interface ExamCode {
  id: string;
  user_id: string; // Foreign key to User
  code: string; // FREE-[8CHAR]-[SUBJECT] or ADV-[8CHAR]
  package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED";
  subject: "BIOLOGY" | "CHEMISTRY" | "PHYSICS";
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00"; // FROM FRONTEND SELECTION
  is_used: boolean; // Track exam completion
  created_at: Date;
  used_at?: Date;
}

interface SessionCapacity {
  id: string;
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00"; // Must match frontend options
  current_count: number;
  max_capacity: number; // 300 exam participants per session
  exam_date: Date; // 27 กันยายน 2568
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

### Project Structure and File Locations

**Database Schema Files:**

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Main Prisma schema definition file
- `prisma/migrations/` - Version-controlled migration files
- `lib/database.ts` - Database connection and client configuration
- `lib/models/` - TypeScript interfaces matching database schema

**Database Configuration:**

```

```

### Business Logic Constraints

**User Registration Constraints:**

- Email must be unique across the system (serves as username)
- Password requirements: 8+ characters, letters + numbers (validated in frontend and backend)
- Thai name field must support UTF-8 Thai characters properly
- PDPA consent is required (boolean true) for account creation
- Package type defaults to "FREE" unless payment confirmed for "ADVANCED"

**Session Management Constraints:**

- Session capacity: Maximum 300 participants per session (morning/afternoon)
- Total system capacity: 20 concurrent users for mock exam simulation
- Session time must match frontend options exactly
- Exam date fixed: 27 กันยายน 2568 (September 27, 2025)

**Data Integrity Requirements:**

- All foreign keys must have proper referential integrity constraints
- Cascade delete policies for dependent data cleanup
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields (email, user_id, session_time)
- UTF-8 encoding for Thai language support across all text fields

[Source: docs/architecture/section-4-data-models.md#business-logic-constraints]

### Security Considerations

**Authentication Security:**

- Password hashing using secure algorithms (bcrypt recommended)
- Email verification tokens with time-based expiry (24 hours)
- Password reset tokens with secure generation and expiry (1 hour)
- Session management through NextAuth.js integration

**Data Protection:**

- PDPA compliance tracking with consent timestamps
- 6-month data lifecycle policy implementation ready
- Audit logging capabilities for admin actions
- Secure token generation for verification and reset workflows

**Database Security:**
