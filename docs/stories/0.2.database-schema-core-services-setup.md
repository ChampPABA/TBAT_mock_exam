### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]

**Database & ORM:**

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Vercel Postgres serverless hosting
- **ORM**: Prisma 5.0+ for type-safe database queries and migrations
- **Caching**: Vercel Edge Config for global edge distribution

**Authentication & Payments:**

- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js 4.0+ with JWT strategy
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe with Thai Baht (THB) support
- **Email Service**: Resend for transactional emails

### File Locations

Based on Next.js 14+ App Router structure:

- Database schema: `/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Auth configuration: `/apps/web/lib/auth.ts`
- Payment utilities: `/apps/web/lib/stripe.ts`
- Email utilities: `/apps/web/lib/email.ts`
- Environment variables: `/apps/web/.env.local`

### Technical Constraints

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All database operations must pass strict type checking
- **Exam-Critical Reliability**: Database transactions must maintain ACID compliance
- **Thai Language Support**: All email templates and user data must support Thai characters
- **Security Requirements**: Password hashing with bcrypt, secure session management

### Business Logic Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture/section-4-data-models.md#business-logic-constraints - Updated for Zone System]

**Exam Code Generation:**

- FREE users: 1 ExamCode with selected subject (e.g., FREE-ABC12345-BIOLOGY)
- ADVANCED users: 1 ExamCode for all 3 subjects (e.g., ADV-XYZ78901)

**Zone Management:**

- FREE Zone: Single subject exam (1 hour) → separate rooms by subject
- ADVANCED Zone: Three subjects exam (full session) → dedicated room

**Capacity & Sessions:**

- Session capacity: 20 concurrent users (2 sessions × 10 students each)
- FREE users: distributed across Biology/Chemistry/Physics rooms
- ADVANCED users: concentrated in dedicated Advanced room

**Data Lifecycle:**

- Data expiry: 6-month lifecycle policy for ExamResult and PDFSolution
- Results display: Subject-separated for both FREE and ADVANCED users

### Environment Variables Structure

Required environment variables:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=

# Payments
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=

# Email
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Edge Config
EDGE_CONFIG=
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- **Database Testing**: Prisma migrations and model validation
- **Authentication Testing**: JWT token generation and validation
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe webhook testing with test payment intents
- **Email Delivery**: Resend API integration with test templates
- **Cache Performance**: Edge Config read/write operations
- **Performance Testing**: Concurrent user load testing (target: 20 users)
- **Error Handling Testing**: Database failure scenarios and recovery patterns

### Manual Verification

- Database migrations run successfully without errors
- NextAuth.js authentication flows work with test users
- Stripe payment intents create and process correctly with THB currency
- Email templates render correctly with Thai language content
- Cache operations perform within acceptable latency thresholds

### Performance Testing Requirements

- **Concurrent User Load**: Test with 20 simultaneous user sessions
- **Database Connection Pool**: Verify pool handles concurrent connections without timeout
- **Response Time Targets**: All database operations complete within 200ms
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption under peak load
- **Session Capacity**: Validate 2 sessions × 10 students capacity management

### Error Handling & Recovery Patterns

- **Database Connection Failures**: Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Payment Processing Errors**: Handle Stripe webhook failures with retry mechanisms
- **Email Delivery Failures**: Queue failed emails for retry with dead letter handling
- **Authentication Timeouts**: Graceful session expiry with user notification
- **Cache Miss Scenarios**: Fallback to database with performance logging
