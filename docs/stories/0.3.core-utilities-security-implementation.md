**Exam Code Generation:**

- Pattern: FREE-[8CHAR]-[SUBJECT] for free package, ADV-[8CHAR] for advanced
- Algorithm: Cryptographically secure random generation
- Collision checking required before saving
- Audit trail for all code generation

**Input Validation Requirements:**

```

### Code Examples & Patterns

**Exam Code Generation Pattern:**

```typescript
// lib/exam-code.ts
import { randomBytes } from "crypto";

export async function generateExamCode(
  packageType: "FREE" | "ADVANCED",
  subject?: "BIOLOGY" | "CHEMISTRY" | "PHYSICS"
): Promise<string> {
  const chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
  const randomPart = randomBytes(8)
    .toString("base64")
    .replace(/[^A-Z0-9]/gi, "")
    .substring(0, 8);

  const code = packageType === "FREE" ? `FREE-${randomPart}-${subject}` : `ADV-${randomPart}`;

  // Check uniqueness against database
  const exists = await prisma.examCode.findUnique({ where: { code } });
  if (exists) return generateExamCode(packageType, subject); // Recursive retry

  return code;
}
```

**PDPA Data Export Format:**

```typescript
// lib/pdpa.ts
interface UserDataExport {
  personalInfo: {
    email: string;
    thaiName: string;
    phone: string;
    school: string;
  };
  examData: {
    codes: ExamCode[];
    results: ExamResult[];
    payments: Payment[];
  };
  metadata: {
    exportedAt: Date;
    dataRetentionExpiry: Date;
    format: "JSON" | "CSV";
  };
}
```

**Rate Limiting Configuration:**

```typescript
// lib/rate-limit.ts
export const rateLimitConfig = {
  standard: { windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 },
  auth: { windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 5 },
  payment: { windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, max: 10 },
  pdpa: { windowMs: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, max: 3 },
};
```

### Performance Requirements

**Response Time Targets:**

- Exam code generation: < 100ms (including uniqueness check)
- Password hashing: < 200ms
- PDPA data export: < 5 seconds for full user data
- Input validation: < 10ms per field
- Rate limit check: < 5ms

**Concurrent Load Targets:**

- Support 20 concurrent exam code generations
- Handle 100 concurrent API requests with rate limiting
- Process 10 concurrent PDPA data exports

### Integration Points

**External Service Integrations:**

1. **Sentry Integration:**
   - DSN: `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable
   - Environment: `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` (development/staging/production)
   - Release tracking: Auto-detect from git commit

2. **Existing Service Connections:**
   - Prisma Client: Use existing singleton from `lib/prisma.ts`
   - Redis Client: Use existing connection from `lib/redis.ts`
   - NextAuth: Extend existing session from `lib/auth.ts`

3. **API Route Integration:**
   ```typescript
   // All API routes must include:
   import { validateRequest } from "@/lib/api-validation";
   import { rateLimit } from "@/lib/rate-limit";
   import { auditLog } from "@/lib/monitoring";
   ```

### Monitoring & Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

- Failed login attempts per hour (threshold: >50 = alert)
- Exam code generation failures (threshold: >1% = investigate)
- PDPA request response time P95 (target: <5s)
- Rate limit violations per endpoint (monitor for abuse)
- Sentry error rate (critical: >10 errors/minute)

**Dashboard Metrics:**

```typescript
// lib/monitoring.ts
export const metrics = {
  security: {
    failedLogins: "auth.login.failed",
    accountLockouts: "auth.account.locked",
    rateLimitHits: "ratelimit.exceeded",
  },
  pdpa: {
    dataExports: "pdpa.export.count",
    dataDeletions: "pdpa.delete.count",
    consentUpdates: "pdpa.consent.updated",
  },
  performance: {
    codeGenTime: "examcode.generation.duration",
    validationTime: "validation.duration",
  },
};
```

### Rollback Plan

**If Critical Issues Occur:**

1. **Immediate Actions (< 5 minutes):**
   - Disable Sentry if causing performance issues: Set `SENTRY_ENABLED=false`
   - Revert rate limiting to previous values via environment variables
   - Switch to simplified validation schemas if causing errors

2. **Rollback Procedure:**

   ```bash
   # Quick rollback via feature flags
   ENABLE_ENHANCED_SECURITY=false
   ENABLE_PDPA_FEATURES=false
   ENABLE_SENTRY_MONITORING=false

   # Full code rollback if needed
   git revert HEAD
   vercel rollback [deployment-id]
   ```

3. **Data Rollback:**
   - PDPA consent records: Soft delete with `deleted_at` timestamp
   - Audit logs: Never delete, mark with `rollback_reason`
   - Rate limit counters: Auto-reset via Redis TTL

### Migration Strategy

**Database Migrations Required:**

```sql
-- New tables for Story 0.3
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (...);
CREATE TABLE pdpa_consents (...);
CREATE TABLE security_events (...);

-- New columns on existing tables
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN failed_login_attempts INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN locked_until TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE exam_codes ADD COLUMN generation_metadata JSONB;
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: The implementation demonstrates strong security fundamentals with comprehensive PDPA compliance, robust authentication mechanisms, and proper error handling. However, there are critical security concerns that need immediate attention.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent exam code generation with cryptographic randomness and collision detection
- Comprehensive PDPA implementation with data export, deletion, and consent management
- Strong password security with bcrypt (saltRounds=12) and account lockout mechanism
- Well-structured input validation using Zod with Thai language support
- Good separation of concerns across utility modules

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **Security Log vs Audit Log Inconsistency**: The code uses both `securityLog` and `auditLog` models inconsistently, which could lead to runtime errors
2. **Missing Error Monitoring Import**: Several files reference `logSecurityEvent` and `SecurityEventType` without proper imports
3. **Incomplete Docker Security Testing**: Docker environment testing remains pending (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)
4. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Integration and E2E tests are not completed

### Refactoring Performed

None performed - critical issues require developer attention before refactoring.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Import issues and model inconsistencies
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established patterns  
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing integration/E2E tests, Docker tests pending
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC7 and AC8 (Docker security) not fully validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Fix SecurityLog/AuditLog model inconsistency throughout codebase
- [ ] Add missing imports for SecurityEventType in rate-limit.ts
- [ ] Complete Docker environment testing for all utilities
- [ ] Implement integration tests for PDPA workflows
- [ ] Add E2E tests for security scenarios
- [ ] Verify Sentry integration in all environments
- [ ] Test rate limiting under concurrent load
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for exam code generation failures
- [ ] Implement request signing for sensitive API endpoints
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### Security Review

**Critical Findings:**
1. **Password Hash Exposure Risk**: Error messages may leak timing information about password validation
2. **Rate Limiting Bypass**: IP-based rate limiting can be bypassed with proxy rotation
3. **Insufficient Input Sanitization**: DOMPurify only applied to some fields, not consistently
4. **Missing CSRF Protection**: No CSRF tokens implemented for state-changing operations
5. **Audit Log Authentication**: Using wrong model (AuditLog vs AdminUser) in admin routes

**Recommendations:**
- Implement constant-time password comparison
- Add user-based rate limiting in addition to IP-based
- Apply sanitization consistently across all user inputs
- Implement CSRF tokens for all POST/PUT/DELETE operations
- Fix model references to use correct authentication

### Performance Considerations

**Observed Issues:**
1. **Recursive Exam Code Generation**: Could cause stack overflow with high collision rate
2. **Synchronous Audit Logging**: Could impact response times under load
3. **No Caching Strategy**: Missing caching for frequently accessed data

**Recommendations:**
- Implement iterative approach for exam code generation with max retry limit
- Use background job queue for audit logging
- Add Redis caching for user sessions and exam codes

### NFR Assessment

**Security**: CONCERNS - Critical authentication and authorization issues
**Performance**: PASS - Meets response time targets (<200ms) but needs optimization
**Reliability**: CONCERNS - Missing retry mechanisms and error recovery
**Maintainability**: PASS - Good code structure and documentation

### Files Modified During Review

None - critical issues require developer resolution first.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/0.3-core-utilities-security-implementation.yml

**Developer Fixes Verified:**
✅ CSRF Protection implemented (csrf.ts created with comprehensive utilities)
✅ User-based rate limiting added alongside IP-based  
✅ Exam code generation converted from recursive to iterative with MAX_COLLISION_RETRIES
✅ SecurityEventType imports added to rate-limit.ts
✅ Both SecurityLog and AuditLog models exist in Prisma schema

**NEW CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED:**
❌ **Model Usage Error**: Code incorrectly uses `prisma.auditLog` for user actions when it should use `prisma.securityLog`. The AuditLog model requires `adminId` and is specifically for admin actions, while SecurityLog is for general security events. This will cause runtime failures in:
- `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` (lines 115, 192, 215, 357)
- `apps/web/lib/pdpa.ts` (lines 100, 242, 335, 383)

### Refactoring Performed

None - critical model usage error must be fixed first to prevent runtime failures.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Model usage violates schema constraints
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Docker tests and integration tests still pending
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC7 and AC8 (Docker validation) incomplete

### Improvements Checklist

**CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Deployment:**
- [ ] Replace `prisma.auditLog` with `prisma.securityLog` in auth.ts and pdpa.ts
- [ ] Complete Docker environment testing (Tasks 1,2,3,5,6,7)
- [ ] Implement CSRF middleware in API routes (utilities exist but not used)

**HIGH Priority:**
- [ ] Add integration tests for PDPA workflows
- [ ] Add E2E tests for security scenarios
- [ ] Implement device fingerprinting for enhanced rate limiting

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- [ ] Add streaming for large PDPA data exports
- [ ] Implement constant-time password comparison
- [ ] Add background job queue for audit logging

### Security Review

**Critical Finding:**
Model usage will cause authentication and PDPA operations to fail at runtime. The AuditLog model has a required `adminId` field and foreign key constraint to AdminUser table, but the code attempts to use it for regular user actions.

**Risk Assessment:**
- 1 Critical risk (score 9): Model schema inconsistency
- 1 High risk (score 6): Docker security unvalidated
- 8 Medium risks identified
- 4 Low risks identified

### Performance Considerations

Performance targets met (<200ms response times) but optimization opportunities exist for PDPA exports and audit logging.

### NFR Assessment

**Security**: FAIL - Model usage error will break authentication
**Performance**: PASS - Meets targets with optimization opportunities  
**Reliability**: CONCERNS - Audit logging will fail due to model error
**Maintainability**: PASS - Good structure and documentation

### Files Modified During Review

None - model usage error requires developer fix.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/0.3-core-utilities-security-implementation.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ **CRITICAL Changes Required** - Fix model usage before any deployment
(Story owner must address model usage error immediately)
