```

### Authentication & Session Management

[Source: Story 1.1#authentication-session-management]
**Phase 1 (Mock):** Mock JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies (already implemented)

- **Extend existing auth.ts** with login method using bcrypt.compare()
- **Session validation:** Use existing JWT verification middleware
- **Cookie settings:** Use same secure HTTP-only cookie configuration from registration
- Token expiry: 24 hours (maintain consistency)

### Form Validation Requirements

[Source: Story 1.1#form-validation-requirements]
**Login Form Validation:**

- **Email:** Format validation on blur with clear error messages (reuse registration patterns)
- **Password:** Required field validation (no strength requirements for login)
- **Error Display:** Inline below fields + summary at top for multiple errors
- **Loading States:** Show loading during authentication process

### Mock API Implementation Strategy

[Source: Story 1.1#mock-api-implementation-strategy]
**Extend Existing Mock Services:**

```typescript
// Extend Mock Authentication Service
mockAuth.login(email: string, password: string) => Promise<{success, user, token, error?}>

// Reuse existing Mock User Data
mockUsers = [existing sample users with hashed passwords]
```

### Responsive Design Requirements

[Source: Story 1.1#responsive-design-requirements]
**Breakpoint Strategy (consistent with registration):**

- **Mobile (320px-767px):** Single column, full-width fields
- **Tablet (768px-1023px):** Centered form with appropriate spacing
- **Desktop (1024px+):** Optimized centered form with proper spacing
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px × 44px for mobile interactions

### Accessibility Requirements

[Source: Story 1.1#accessibility-requirements]
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance (consistent with registration):**

- **Form Labels:** Descriptive labels for all form controls
- **Error Announcements:** Screen reader announcements for validation errors
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full form completion via keyboard only
- **Color Contrast:** 4.5:1 minimum for form text and error states
- **Focus Management:** Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements

### Thai Localization Requirements

**Login Form Text:**

- Email field label: "อีเมล"
- Password field label: "รหัสผ่าน"
- Login button: "เข้าสู่ระบบ"
- Forgot password link: "ลืมรหัสผ่าน?"
- Error messages in Thai with clear guidance

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: Story 1.1#testing-standards]
**Testing Framework:** Vitest with React Testing Library (already configured)
**Test File Locations:**

- Component tests: `apps/web/src/components/__tests__/`
- API tests: `apps/web/src/app/api/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/__tests__/integration/`

**Required Test Coverage:**

- **Component Testing:** LoginForm validation, error states, success flow
- **API Testing:** Login endpoint with various scenarios (valid/invalid credentials)
- **Integration Testing:** Complete login user journey with dashboard redirect
- **Accessibility Testing:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with axe-core
- **Responsive Testing:** Form functionality across all breakpoints
- **Mock Service Testing:** Validate login API responses and error scenarios

**Testing Patterns:**

```typescript
// Component test structure
describe("LoginForm", () => {
  it("validates required email field");
  it("validates email format");
  it("validates required password field");
  it("submits successfully with valid credentials");
  it("displays appropriate error messages for invalid credentials");
  it("shows loading state during authentication");
});

// Integration test structure
describe("Login Flow", () => {
  it("completes full login journey and redirects to dashboard");
  it("handles network errors gracefully");
  it("maintains session state after successful login");
});
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: Story 1.1#performance-requirements]
**Performance Targets:**

- **Form Validation:** < 100ms response time for real-time validation
- **Login Processing:** < 1s for authentication completion
- **Dashboard Redirect:** < 500ms for post-login navigation
- **Page Load:** < 2.5s LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - Story 1.2 Login implementation demonstrates high-quality code with comprehensive test coverage, proper security implementation, and adherence to established patterns from Story 1.1. All 9 acceptance criteria have been fully implemented and validated through extensive testing.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/web/src/components/forms/LoginForm.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced `window.location.href = "/dashboard"` with Next.js `router.push("/dashboard")`
  - **Why**: Improves performance by using client-side navigation instead of full page reload
  - **How**: Added `useRouter` from `next/navigation` for proper Next.js App Router navigation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to React Hook Form + Zod patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect Next.js 14 App Router structure maintained  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive coverage at component, API, and integration levels
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items you handled yourself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Refactored login form to use Next.js router for better performance (LoginForm.tsx)
- [x] Verified security implementation with HTTP-only cookies and bcrypt hashing
- [x] Validated comprehensive test coverage across all testing levels
- [x] Confirmed proper Thai localization and accessibility considerations
- [ ] Consider adding ARIA live regions for enhanced screen reader support
- [ ] Consider implementing login attempt rate limiting for production readiness
- [ ] Consider adding CSP headers for additional security hardening

### Security Review

**EXCELLENT** - Implementation follows security best practices with no critical vulnerabilities found:

- ✅ bcrypt password hashing in mock authentication service
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS token theft attacks  
- ✅ Secure cookie configuration (sameSite: 'lax', proper expiry)
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure in client-side responses
- ✅ Server-side token validation for protected dashboard route
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage

### Performance Considerations

**GOOD** - Performance targets met with room for minor improvements:

- ✅ Form validation < 100ms with real-time feedback
- ✅ Loading states implemented during authentication
- ✅ Optimized component imports and bundle structure
- ✅ Simulated realistic network delays (300-1100ms) in mock service
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Client-side navigation now uses Next.js router for better performance

### Files Modified During Review

- `apps/web/src/components/forms/LoginForm.tsx` - Enhanced with Next.js router navigation
- **Request**: Dev should update File List to reflect QA improvements

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-login.yml
