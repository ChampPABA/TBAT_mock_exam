# Story 2.4.1: Authentication UI Completion

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Frontend Developer,
**I want** to create comprehensive authentication UI components (login modal, logout functionality) with 5 design variations for stakeholder selection,
**so that** users can authenticate properly with the backend APIs from Story 2.4 and have a complete auth experience integrated with the existing registration system from Story 1.2.1.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** Create 5 distinct authentication UI design variations that integrate with the existing TBAT design system and are displayed on a single comparison page for stakeholder selection

**AC2:** Implement login modal component that works seamlessly with the backend authentication APIs from Story 2.4 (POST /api/auth/signin)

**AC3:** Create logout functionality with proper state management and user feedback that integrates with JWT session management from Story 2.4

**AC4:** Implement authentication state management UI showing logged-in/logged-out states with user session information

**AC5:** Add protected route indicators and authentication status display that works with existing registration flow from Story 1.2.1

**AC6:** Ensure all authentication components are mobile-responsive and follow TBAT medical academic color palette and Thai language requirements

## Human-in-Loop Design Selection Process

**CRITICAL**: This story requires human approval before implementation proceeds.

### Phase 1: Design Presentation (Developer Task 1)

Create a single comparison page (`/auth-ui-options`) displaying all 5 design variations side-by-side with:
- Interactive mockups using existing shadcn/ui components
- TBAT design system compliance (#0d7276 primary, #529a9d secondary, #cae0e1 light)
- Thai language labels and messaging
- Mobile-responsive previews
- Clear design option labels (Option A, B, C, D, E)

### Phase 2: Stakeholder Selection (Human Decision)

**HALT DEVELOPMENT** until stakeholder selects preferred design option by:
- Reviewing all 5 options on the comparison page
- Considering mobile usability and Thai user experience
- Selecting one option for final implementation
- Documenting selection rationale in story comments

### Phase 3: Implementation (Developer Task 2-6)

Proceed with full implementation of selected design only after human approval documented in story.

## Authentication UI Design Options

### Option A: Modal-Centered Traditional
**Concept**: Classic login modal with centered form layout
- **Login Modal**: Center-screen overlay with email/password fields
- **Logout**: Simple dropdown menu with "‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏ö" button

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 1.2.1 Delivered Registration Frontend:**
- ‚úÖ Complete 3-step registration flow with password fields
- ‚úÖ Session selection (09:00-12:00 / 13:00-16:00) with capacity display
- ‚úÖ Thai language validation messages and mobile-responsive design
- ‚úÖ PDPA consent integration and shadcn/ui component usage

**Story 2.4 Delivered Backend APIs:**
- ‚úÖ POST /api/auth/register - Registration endpoint (no email verification)
- ‚úÖ POST /api/auth/signin - Login endpoint with enhanced security
- ‚úÖ Password reset APIs: /api/auth/forgot-password, /api/auth/reset-password
- ‚úÖ JWT session management with account lockout protection
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and comprehensive security audit logging

### Authentication Flow Integration

**Registration ‚Üí Authentication Flow:**
1. User completes registration (Story 1.2.1) ‚Üí User record created (Story 2.4)
2. User receives "Registration successful. Welcome to TBAT Mock Exam!" message
3. User can immediately login using registered email/password
4. Authentication state persists for 7 days (JWT expiry from Story 2.4)

### Design System Requirements

**TBAT Medical Academic Color Palette:**
- **Primary**: #0d7276 (dark teal) - main CTAs, headers, focus states
- **Secondary**: #529a9d (medium teal) - secondary buttons, borders
- **Light**: #cae0e1 (light teal) - backgrounds, subtle accents
- **Clean**: #fdfefe (white) - card backgrounds, content areas
- **Gray**: #90bfc0 (soft gray) - text, disabled states

**Thai Language Considerations:**
- All authentication messages in Thai language
- Proper font rendering for Thai characters (Noto Sans Thai)
- Cultural considerations: formal language for medical context
- Error messages should be helpful and respectful

### Technical Integration Points

**File Locations:**
- `/auth-ui-options` page: `apps/web/app/auth-ui-options/page.tsx`
- Login Modal: `apps/web/components/auth/login-modal.tsx`
- Logout Component: `apps/web/components/auth/logout-button.tsx`
- Auth State Provider: `apps/web/providers/auth-provider.tsx`
- Protected Route Wrapper: `apps/web/components/auth/protected-route.tsx`

**API Integration:**
- Use existing authentication endpoints from Story 2.4
- Implement JWT token management with 7-day expiry
- Handle rate limiting responses (429 status codes)
- Integrate with existing security audit logging

**State Management:**
- Use React Context for authentication state
- Persist login state in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Implement automatic token refresh before expiry
- Handle concurrent session management

**Network Error Handling Scenarios:**
- Network timeout errors (> 30 seconds): Show retry with Thai message "‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠‡∏´‡∏°‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≤ ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà"
- Server 500 errors: Display "‡πÄ‡∏ã‡∏¥‡∏£‡πå‡∏ü‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏≠‡∏£‡πå‡∏Ç‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á"
- Network disconnection: Show offline indicator "‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏£‡πå‡πÄ‡∏ô‡πá‡∏ï"
- API timeout during login: Implement exponential backoff retry (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Rate limiting (429): Display cooldown timer with Thai message
- Invalid token errors: Automatic logout with explanation

### Testing

**Unit Testing Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library
**Test File Location:** Co-located with components (*.test.tsx)

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- Each authentication component (login modal, logout button, auth provider)
- Authentication state management logic and context providers
- Form validation rules and error message display

**Integration Testing Framework:** Jest with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
**Integration Test Scenarios:**
- Complete authentication flow with mocked backend APIs
- Registration ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Logout workflow end-to-end
- Protected route access validation and redirect logic
- Authentication state persistence across browser sessions
- Mobile responsive behavior across viewport sizes
- Rate limiting integration and user feedback

**E2E Testing Framework:** Playwright
**E2E Test Critical Paths:**
- User journey: Registration (Story 1.2.1) ‚Üí Login ‚Üí App usage ‚Üí Logout
- Authentication error scenarios: Invalid credentials, network failures, timeouts
- Mobile device testing: iOS Safari and Android Chrome with Thai language input
- Cross-browser compatibility: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- Performance testing: Login modal response time < 200ms
- Thai language input validation and display accuracy

**Mobile-Specific Testing:**

- Android Chrome: Touch interaction responsiveness
- Viewport adaptation: 320px to 1920px width testing
- Touch target accessibility: Minimum 44px touch areas
- Network condition simulation: 3G, 4G, WiFi scenarios

### Security Considerations

**Frontend Security Measures:**
- JWT tokens stored securely (httpOnly cookies preferred)
- Automatic logout on token expiry
- Rate limiting awareness and user feedback
- CSRF protection integration with Next.js
- Input sanitization for authentication forms

**Integration with Story 2.4 Security:**
- Account lockout UI feedback (5 failed attempts = 30-minute cooldown)
- Rate limiting message display in Thai
- Security event logging integration (login attempts, logouts)
- Password reset flow integration with existing APIs
