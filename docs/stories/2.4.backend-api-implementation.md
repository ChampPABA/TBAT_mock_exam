## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 2.3 Completion Insights:**
- ✅ PasswordReset table is ready with crypto.randomUUID() secure token generation
- ✅ EmailVerification model already removed from database schema per PO FR1 requirements
- ✅ Security audit logging infrastructure (SecurityLog table) is fully functional
- ✅ Thai character support verified with UTF-8 indexes on thai_name and school fields
- ✅ QA security fixes implemented: SEC-001 (secure tokens), SEC-002 (atomic transactions)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Current registration API still contains email verification code that must be removed

### Data Models Architecture

**User Authentication Schema (Authoritative):**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // UUID primary key
  email: string; // Unique identifier (serves as username)
  password_hash: string; // Hashed password (8+ chars, letters+numbers)
  thai_name: string; // Thai display name from frontend
  phone: string; // Contact number from registration
  school: string; // High school name selection
  line_id?: string; // Optional LINE contact
  package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED"; // Package selection from frontend
  is_upgraded: boolean; // Track upgrade status
  pdpa_consent: boolean; // GDPR compliance checkbox
  failedLoginAttempts: number; // Account lockout tracking
  lockedUntil?: Date; // 30-minute lockout enforcement
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}

interface PasswordReset {
  id: string; // UUID primary key
  userId: string; // Foreign key to User
  resetToken: string; // Crypto-secure token (unique)
  expiresAt: Date; // 24-hour expiry
  isUsed: boolean; // Single-use enforcement
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Technology Stack Integration

**Authentication Technology Stack:**

- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds (existing in package.json)
- **JWT Tokens**: jsonwebtoken library for secure token generation (existing in package.json)
- **Rate Limiting**: express-rate-limit with Upstash Redis backend (existing in lib/rate-limit.ts)
- **Email Service**: Resend API for password reset emails (existing in lib/email.ts)
- **Session Management**: NextAuth.js 4.0+ with 7-day JWT expiry (existing in lib/auth.ts)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL on Vercel Postgres (existing configuration)

[Source: docs/architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md#authentication-security]

### Security Requirements

**Authentication Security Standards:**

- **Password Policy**: 8+ characters, letters+numbers, bcrypt 12 rounds (existing validation)
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts = 30-minute cooldown (existing implementation in lib/auth.ts)
- **Rate Limiting**: Auth endpoints protected with express-rate-limit (existing configuration)
- **Token Security**: crypto.randomUUID() for reset tokens, 24-hour expiry (implemented in Story 2.3)
- **Audit Logging**: SecurityLog table captures all authentication events (existing in schema)
- **PDPA Compliance**: IP address and timestamp logging for consent tracking (existing)

[Source: docs/architecture/section-4-data-models.md#security-requirements]

### PRD FR1 Alignment Critical

**FR1 Requirement**: "Simple email/password user registration without OTP or email verification requirements"

- **Current Issue**: `/api/auth/register` still contains email verification code (Lines 74-121)
- **Required Fix**: Complete removal of verification token generation and email sending
- **New Message**: "Registration successful. Welcome to TBAT Mock Exam!" (no verification mention)
- **Database**: VerificationToken model already removed in Story 2.3

### Email Template Requirements

**Password Reset Email Template:**
- **Subject**: "รีเซ็ตรหัสผ่าน - TBAT Mock Exam Platform"
- **Content**: Professional Thai language template
- **Security**: Clear 24-hour expiry warning
- **Link**: Secure reset URL with token parameter
- **Branding**: TBAT platform styling consistent with registration emails

[Source: apps/web/lib/email.ts#existing-templates]

### Testing Standards

**Authentication Testing Requirements:**

- **Unit Tests**: Jest framework for API endpoint testing
- **Integration Tests**: Database transaction testing with Prisma
- **Security Tests**: Rate limiting and lockout mechanism validation
- **Load Tests**: 20 concurrent users simulation (architecture requirement)
- **Email Tests**: Template rendering and delivery validation
- **Migration Tests**: Schema cleanup verification

### Rate Limiting Configuration

**Existing Rate Limit Configurations (lib/rate-limit.ts):**
```typescript
export const rateLimitConfigs = {
  auth: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 5, // 5 attempts per window
  },
  register: {
    windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
    max: 3, // 3 registration attempts per hour
  },
  passwordReset: {
    windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
    max: 3, // 3 password reset attempts per hour
  }
}
```

[Source: apps/web/lib/rate-limit.ts#rateLimitConfigs]

### Business Logic Constraints

**Authentication Flow Constraints:**
- **Email Uniqueness**: Enforced at database level with unique constraint
- **Password Requirements**: 8+ characters, letters + numbers (no special chars for Thai users)
- **Session Expiry**: 7 days maximum with automatic renewal
- **Account Lockout**: 30-minute cooldown after 5 failed attempts
- **Token Expiry**: Password reset tokens expire in 24 hours
- **Single Use**: Reset tokens invalidated after successful password change
