# Story 1.3: Modal-Based Authentication System (DRAFT - Pending SM Approval)

**Epic:** Epic 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure  
**Story:** 1.3 - Modal-Based Authentication System

**Note:** This story was created by Dev Agent to document implementation work done. Awaiting Scrum Master review and formal story creation.

## Status
✅ **Done**

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to access login and registration through modal dialogs instead of separate pages,  
**so that** I have a smoother user experience without page navigation.

## Context
This story addresses the improvements needed from stories 1.1 (Registration) and 1.2 (Login) by converting the authentication flow to use modal dialogs instead of route-based pages.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Login functionality is accessible through a modal dialog
2. Registration uses "กรอก BoxSet Code" modal instead of "สมัครฟรี" 
3. Users can switch between login and registration modals seamlessly
4. Modals can be closed with ESC key or clicking outside
5. All form validations and error handling from 1.1 and 1.2 remain functional
6. Navigation buttons trigger modals instead of routing to pages
7. Existing /login and /register routes remain functional for direct access
8. Modal states are properly managed and reset when closed

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02 (Updated)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Quality Assessment Summary
**SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED** - The modal-based authentication system has been substantially enhanced since the initial review. All critical security concerns have been addressed, comprehensive testing is in place, and the implementation now meets production-ready standards.

### Key Improvements Since Last Review
1. ✅ **Security Risks (RESOLVED)**: Rate limiting implemented with progressive delays
2. ✅ **BoxSet Validation (RESOLVED)**: Proper validation with real codes and usage tracking
3. ✅ **Testing Gap (RESOLVED)**: Comprehensive unit and E2E test coverage added
4. ✅ **API Implementation (RESOLVED)**: Full API endpoints with proper error handling

### Current Implementation Strengths
- **Security Architecture**: 
  - Rate limiting with 5 attempts per 15 minutes window
  - Progressive delays after failed attempts (0s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 4s)
  - Proper HTTP headers (X-RateLimit-*, Retry-After)
  - Secure cookie implementation with httpOnly flags
  - Audit logging for authentication events
  
- **BoxSet Code Validation**:
  - Real validation logic with expiration dates
  - Usage tracking (prevents code reuse)
  - Rate limiting specific to BoxSet validation (10 attempts/5 min)
  - Debounced input formatting for performance
  
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Unit tests for API routes (login.test.ts)
  - Component tests for modals
  - Comprehensive E2E tests with Playwright (350 lines)
  - Rate limiting behavior tested
  - Mobile responsiveness validated
  - Accessibility compliance verified
  
- **Code Quality**:
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - TypeScript with proper type safety
  - Error boundaries and graceful degradation
  - Responsive design across all breakpoints
  - ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Minor Recommendations
1. **Performance**: Consider implementing request debouncing on login attempts
2. **Security**: Add CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts (currently only rate limiting)
3. **Monitoring**: Implement more detailed audit logging with structured logs
4. **UX**: Add password strength indicator during registration

### Gate Status
