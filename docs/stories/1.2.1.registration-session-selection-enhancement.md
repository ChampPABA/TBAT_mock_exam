# Story 1.2.1: Registration & Session Selection Enhancement

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Frontend Developer,
**I want** to enhance the existing registration page with password fields and add comprehensive session time selection functionality,
**so that** users can complete a more comprehensive registration process matching PO requirements while maintaining the current dedicated page structure (using email as username).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Data Models & Integration Requirements

**User Model - No Changes Required:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string; // Existing - SERVES AS USERNAME (no additional username field needed)
  password_hash: string; // Existing - needs frontend password field added to registration
  thai_name: string; // Existing
  phone: string; // Existing
  school: string; // Existing
  package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED"; // Existing
  pdpa_consent: boolean; // Existing
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}

interface ExamCode {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  code: string;
  package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED";
  subject: "BIOLOGY" | "CHEMISTRY" | "PHYSICS";
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00"; // CRITICAL: This field exists and needs frontend selection
  is_used: boolean;
  created_at: Date;
  used_at?: Date;
}
```

[Source: docs/architecture/section-4-data-models.md]

### Session Capacity Integration

**Session Selection Requirements:**

```typescript
interface SessionCapacity {
  id: string;
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00"; // MUST match ExamCode.session_time
  current_count: number;
  max_capacity: number; // 300 exam participants per session
  exam_date: Date; // 27 กันยายน 2568
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

### File Structure Integration Points

**Existing Registration Implementation Files (Story 1.2):**

- `apps/web/app/register/page.tsx` - Main registration page (MODIFY)
- `apps/web/components/landing/registration-modal.tsx` - Registration form component (MODIFY)
- `apps/web/lib/mock-data.ts` - Mock data service (EXTEND for session data)

**New Component Files to Create:**

- `apps/web/components/forms/session-selection.tsx` - Session time selection component
- `apps/web/components/forms/password-input.tsx` - Password field with toggle visibility (optional)

### Technical Integration Requirements

**Form Validation Integration:**

- Extend existing React Hook Form schema in registration form
- Add password validation schema (8+ chars, letters+numbers)
- Add password confirmation validation (must match password)
- Add session_time required field validation

**Thai Language Error Messages:**

```typescript
const validationMessages = {
  password: {
    required: "กรุณากรอกรหัสผ่าน",
    minLength: "รหัสผ่านต้องมีอย่างน้อย 8 ตัวอักษร",
    pattern: "รหัสผ่านต้องมีทั้งตัวอักษรและตัวเลข",
  },
  confirmPassword: {
    required: "กรุณายืนยันรหัสผ่าน",
    match: "รหัสผ่านไม่ตรงกัน",
  },
  sessionTime: {
    required: "กรุณาเลือกเวลาสอบ",
  },
};
```

### Design System Integration

**shadcn/ui Components to Use:**

- Input component for username field
- Input component with type="password" for password fields
- RadioGroup or Select for session time selection
- Button component for password visibility toggle
- Label components with proper ARIA attributes

**Styling Consistency:**

- Maintain existing TBAT color palette (#0d7276 primary, #529a9d secondary)
- Follow existing form field spacing and layout patterns
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design matches current registration page

### Business Logic Constraints

**Email as Username:**

- Email field already exists in current registration form
- No additional username field needed - email serves as unique identifier
- Email validation already implemented in Story 1.2

**Password Requirements:**

- 8+ characters minimum length
- Must contain both letters and numbers
- Password confirmation field must match
- Frontend validation only - hashing handled by backend

**Security Considerations:**

- Rate limiting: Registration form should implement client-side throttling to prevent rapid submission attempts
- CSRF protection: Form submission should include CSRF token validation (handled by Next.js middleware)
- Input sanitization: All form inputs should be properly sanitized before submission
- Password visibility toggle: Ensure secure handling of password field state

**Session Selection Requirements:**

- Required field - user must select either 9:00-12:00 or 13:00-16:00
- Display Thai time format for better user experience: "เช้า 09:00-12:00" / "บ่าย 13:00-16:00"
- Integrate with package selection - both Free and Advanced users need session selection

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing:**

- Password field validation and confirmation matching
- Session selection component functionality
- Form submission with all new fields

**Integration Testing:**

- Complete registration flow with username, password, and session fields
- Form validation error display in Thai language
- Mobile responsive behavior with new fields
- PDPA consent flow integration with enhanced form

**E2E Testing Updates:**

- Update existing registration E2E tests to include new fields
- Test complete user journey from landing page through registration with session selection
- Test error states for all validation requirements
- Test accessibility with Thai language screen readers

## Testing

### Unit Testing

**Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
**Test Location**: Co-located with components (\*.test.tsx files)
**Key Test Scenarios**:

- Password input validation and confirmation matching (no username field needed)
- Session selection component state management
- Form integration with existing package selection and PDPA consent
- Thai language error message display

### E2E Testing

**Framework**: Playwright (existing test suite)
**Test File Extensions**: Update existing `apps/web/e2e/landing-page.spec.ts`
**Critical User Flows**:

2. Form validation error handling for all new fields
3. Complete registration flow from package selection to session confirmation
4. Mobile responsive behavior testing

### Accessibility Testing

**Standards**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
**Tools**: axe-core automated testing, manual keyboard navigation testing
**Commands**:

```bash
npm run test:accessibility  # Run axe-core accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y:manual    # Manual accessibility testing checklist
```

**Focus Areas**:

- Keyboard navigation through enhanced registration form
- Screen reader compatibility with Thai language content (test with NVDA/JAWS)
- Focus management with new password visibility toggles
- ARIA labels for session selection radio buttons
- Color contrast validation for new form elements
- Touch target size validation for mobile devices

- [ ] Integrate session capacity with live mock data service instead of hard-coded values
- [ ] Add CSRF token validation for enhanced security (framework-level)

### Security Review

**STRONG SECURITY FOUNDATION** with minor enhancement opportunities:
- ✅ **Password Requirements**: Proper 8+ character with alphanumeric validation
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive frontend validation with Thai language support
- ✅ **State Management**: Secure handling of password fields in component state
- ⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Client-side throttling not implemented (mentioned in story requirements)
- ⚠️ **CSRF Protection**: Framework-level protection recommended for form submissions

### Performance Considerations

**GOOD PERFORMANCE** with optimization opportunities:
- ✅ **Rendering**: Efficient conditional rendering for multi-step workflow
- ✅ **State Updates**: Proper state management with minimal unnecessary re-renders
- ⚠️ **Component Size**: Large component could benefit from extraction for maintainability
- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Uses existing shadcn/ui components, no additional dependencies
