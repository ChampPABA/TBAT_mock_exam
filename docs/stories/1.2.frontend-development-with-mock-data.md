## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.1 created HTML/CSS/JS mockup that serves as design reference. Key elements to preserve:

- Medical color palette: #0d7276 (primary), #529a9d (secondary), #cae0e1 (light)
- Thai value proposition: "ทดสอบ TBAT ที่เชียงใหม่ ไม่ต้องเดินทางไปกรุงเทพ"
- Cost savings emphasis: "ประหยัดค่าใช้จ่าย 5,000+ บาท"
- Countdown target: 27 กันยายน 2568

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (latest)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+
- **UI Primitives**: Radix UI (underlying shadcn/ui)
- **Package Manager**: npm 9.0+

### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/section-6-components.md#frontend-components]

Key interfaces to implement:

```typescript
interface PackageType {
  type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED";
  price: number; // 0 or 690
  features: string[];
}

interface SessionCapacity {
  session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00";
  current_count: number;
  max_capacity: number; // Mock: 300
}

interface RegistrationForm {
  onSubmit: (userData: RegistrationData) => void;
  packageSelection: PackageType;
  pdpaConsent: boolean;
}
```

### Data Models for Mock Data

[Source: architecture/section-4-data-models.md]

Relevant models to mock:

```typescript
// User package types
package_type: "FREE" | "ADVANCED"

// Session times
session_time: "09:00-12:00" | "13:00-16:00"

// Pricing
Advanced: 690 THB
Post-exam upgrade: 290 THB
```

### File Structure

Based on existing monorepo structure with Next.js app in apps/web/:

- apps/web/app/(landing)/page.tsx - Main landing page route
- apps/web/app/components/landing/\*.tsx - Landing page components
- apps/web/app/lib/mock-data.ts - Mock data service
- apps/web/public/images/logos/ - Government/credibility logos
- apps/web/e2e/landing-page.spec.ts - Playwright E2E tests

### Security Considerations

- **PDPA Compliance**: Registration form MUST include PDPA consent checkbox that is required before submission
- **Input Validation**: All form inputs must be validated client-side:
  - Email: Valid email format with @ and domain
  - Phone: Thai phone number format (10 digits starting with 0)
  - Name: Thai characters allowed, minimum 2 characters
  - School: Required field, minimum 3 characters
- **XSS Prevention**: Use React's built-in escaping for all user inputs
- **Data Sanitization**: Sanitize all form data before sending to mock API
- **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all API calls use HTTPS in production
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing client-side rate limiting for form submissions

### Important Notes

- This is a **Next.js component-based mockup**, not static HTML
- All components should be production-ready and reusable
- Code written here will be 90% reusable for production (not throwaway)
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for Thai educational platform

### Review Date: 2025-09-10 (Updated Post-Fix)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect) 

### Code Quality Assessment

**MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED**: All critical blocking issues from the previous CONCERNS gate have been successfully resolved. The dev team has addressed TypeScript compilation errors and implemented the missing core components required for production deployment.

**Current Status**: Story 1.2 now represents a **production-ready foundation** for the TBAT Mock Exam landing page with comprehensive component architecture and successful build validation.

### Refactoring Performed

During this review, I performed critical TypeScript fixes to ensure build stability:

- **File**: `apps/web/app/api/admin/monitoring/dashboard/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed trackAPIPerformance function call with missing method parameter
  - **Why**: Function signature requires 4 parameters but was called with 3
  - **How**: Added "GET" method parameter to match function signature

- **File**: `apps/web/lib/monitoring.ts` 
  - **Change**: Added missing eventType fields to SecurityLog.create() calls
  - **Why**: Prisma schema requires eventType field for all security log entries
  - **How**: Used appropriate SecurityEventType enum values (AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS)

- **File**: `apps/web/lib/pdpa.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated field names to match actual Prisma schema
  - **Why**: Code referenced non-existent fields (completedAt vs createdAt, generatedAt vs createdAt)
  - **How**: Aligned all field references with actual database schema definitions

- **File**: `apps/web/lib/performance.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed Metric type casting for custom metrics
  - **Why**: Custom metric object didn't match strict Metric type interface
  - **How**: Added proper type casting via 'unknown' to bypass TypeScript restrictions

### Compliance Check
