### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md#project-structure-enhanced]

```
/apps/
  /web/                    # Next.js application
/packages/
  /ui/                     # Shared shadcn/ui components
  /lib/                    # Shared utilities
  /mock-services/          # Mock data services (Phase 1)
  /mcp-servers/            # MCP configurations for AI features
  /playwright-tests/       # E2E test suites
```

### Color Palette Configuration

[Source: docs/front-end-spec/branding-style-guide.md#color-palette]
Tailwind config custom colors:

- `primary`: #0d7276 (main CTAs, headers)
- `secondary`: #529a9d (hover states, secondary buttons)
- `light`: #cae0e1 (backgrounds, borders)
- `accent`: #90bfc0 (highlights, progress)

### Docker Configuration Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md#development-strategy]

- **PostgreSQL**: 15+ with persistent volumes
- **Redis**: For session management and caching
- **Next.js**: Hot reload for rapid development
- **Environment Parity**: Match production deployment structure

### File Locations

Based on Turborepo monorepo structure:

- Root: `turbo.json`, `package.json`, `docker-compose.yml`
- Apps: `/apps/web/` (main Next.js application)
- Packages: `/packages/ui/`, `/packages/lib/`
- Config: `.github/workflows/`, `.env.example`

### Technical Constraints

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code must pass strict type checking
- **Exam-Critical Reliability**: Zero-downtime deployment pipeline
- **Performance Targets**: <2 second load times, 200+ concurrent users
- **Thai Language Support**: Prompt font integration required

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md#quality-assurance]
Pipeline stages:

1. **Lint**: ESLint code quality checks
2. **Type Check**: TypeScript compilation validation
3. **Test**: Jest unit tests (when implemented)
4. **Build**: Next.js production build verification
5. **Deploy**: Vercel automatic deployment

### Environment Variables Structure

Required environment variables:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=

# Payments
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=

# Email
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Redis
REDIS_URL=
```

### Review Date: 2025-01-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: SOLID FOUNDATION WITH MINOR REFINEMENTS NEEDED**

The project scaffolding has been implemented to a high standard with proper Turborepo architecture, comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, and robust Docker development environment. The foundation meets enterprise-grade requirements for the TBAT Mock Exam Platform.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Complete Turborepo monorepo structure with proper workspace configuration
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled across all packages with zero type errors
- ✅ Tailwind CSS + custom medical color palette properly configured
- ✅ Functional GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with multi-stage validation
- ✅ Docker Compose development environment with hot reload and persistence
- ✅ ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks working correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive environment variable structure with validation

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring was required during this review. The implementation follows proper architectural patterns and coding standards.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ TypeScript strict mode, consistent formatting with Prettier
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Turborepo architecture matches specification requirements
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ Foundation ready, actual tests will be implemented per story requirements
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ 6/7 ACs fully implemented, 1 AC needs completion (see details below)

### Acceptance Criteria Analysis

**✅ AC1 - Turborepo Structure**: Complete monorepo with /apps/web, /apps/docs, /packages/ui, /packages/lib
**✅ AC2 - TypeScript Configuration**: Strict mode enabled, path aliases configured, zero type errors
**⚠️ AC3 - Tailwind + shadcn/ui**: Colors configured but missing `components.json` - needs `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
**✅ AC4 - GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline with test, lint, typecheck, build stages functional
**✅ AC5 - Code Quality Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks working
**✅ AC6 - Environment Variables**: Complete .env.example with all required variables
**✅ AC7 - Docker Development**: Full Docker Compose orchestration with hot reload and persistence

### Issues Found & Recommendations

**MEDIUM Priority:**

- **CONFIG-001**: shadcn/ui setup incomplete - missing `components.json` configuration file
  - **Action Required**: Run `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` in web app directory
- **FONT-001**: Prompt font for Thai language not implemented in layout.tsx
  - **Action Required**: Replace Geist fonts with Prompt font configuration

**LOW Priority:**

- **LINT-001**: ESLint deprecation warnings (Next.js 16 preparation)
- **PACKAGE-001**: Module type warnings in packages/ui

### Security Review

✅ **PASSED** - Environment variables properly templated, no secrets exposed, Docker security practices followed.

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PASSED** - Build optimization successful:

- Web app: 112kB first load JS
- Docs app: 117kB first load JS
- Static page generation working correctly
