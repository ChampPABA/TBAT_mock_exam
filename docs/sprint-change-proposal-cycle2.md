## 4. Specific Proposed Edits

### 4.1 Immediate Code Changes

```typescript
// Before: src/types/user.ts
interface Package {
  type: 'FREE' | 'VVIP';
  // ...
}

// After: 
interface Package {
  type: 'FREE' | 'ADVANCED';
  // ...
}
```

### 4.2 New API Endpoints

```typescript
// New endpoints required
POST /api/upgrade/post-exam    // Handle 290 THB upgrade
GET /api/scoring/tbat          // Calculate TBAT scores
GET /api/gallery/images        // Serve gallery images
```

### 4.3 Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Add to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN upgraded_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN access_expires_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN line_group_joined BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Update package types
UPDATE packages SET type = 'ADVANCED' WHERE type = 'VVIP';
```

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Rebranding breaks existing code | MEDIUM | HIGH | Comprehensive search/replace with testing |
| Authentication changes cause security issues | LOW | CRITICAL | Thorough security testing, code review |
| Post-exam upgrade complexity | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Reuse existing payment flow logic |
| Timeline pressure | HIGH | HIGH | Prioritize MVP-critical features |
