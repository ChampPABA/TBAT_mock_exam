## Test Credentials

For QA testing, use these credentials:

| User Type     | Email                    | Password    |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Super Admin   | superadmin@tbat-exam.com | admin123    |
| Admin         | admin@tbat-exam.com      | admin123    |
| Free User     | free1@test.com           | password123 |
| Advanced User | advanced1@test.com       | password123 |

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Warnings**: Some type definitions need refinement in seed script
2. **Jest Configuration**: Needs adjustment for ESM modules
3. **Prisma Warning**: Config deprecation warning (non-critical)

## Recommendations for QA

1. **Priority Tests**:
   - Verify user authentication flow
   - Test payment processing with Stripe test keys
   - Validate exam code generation uniqueness
   - Check session capacity constraints

2. **Performance Tests**:
   - Database connection pooling under load
   - Redis cache hit rates
   - Query response times

3. **Security Tests**:
   - Password hashing verification
   - JWT token validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - PDPA compliance checks

## Environment Setup for QA

```bash
# 1. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Setup database
cd apps/web
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed

# 3. Access tools
- Database GUI: http://localhost:8080 (pgAdmin)
- Prisma Studio: npm run db:studio
- Redis CLI: docker exec -it tbat_mock_exam-redis-1 redis-cli
```
